headphones,"I listened to a Topping stack and now I don't know what I believe anymore.. My little brother recently decided to bite the bullet and upgrade his Ifi hip-dac to a Topping d10/l30 stack.

 I've been reading a lot and the internet had me convinced that all amps sound the same if not pushed to their limits, and differences between modern dacs are indiscernible and anyone claiming otherwise has golden ears. 

This belief of mine was strengthened when I A/B tested his hip dac and my Ifi Zen stack and neither of us could hear a difference unless we cranked the volume up to distortion levels 

Thus I was surprised when he said after it arrived that ""The topping stack had better soundstage"". 

Today I had a chance to listen to his stack and I started with a healthy dose of scepticism, because two stacks in the same price range should have have only subtle differences, if any.

I was immediately blown away.. it was night and day. The topping stack was wide, clean and detailed. The zen stack was narrow, congested and compressed but warm in comparison. I couldn't believe how apparent it was. 

We tested a few different headphones and the most striking case was the Meze 99 neos. They are by nature headphones with narrow soundstage and muddy midrange. 

On the ifi stack they were exactly this and unsatisfying to listen to. The topping stack compensated for the above beautifully and they were actually a pleasure.

We carefully level matched and did blind testing too, and my entire family could hear the difference.

 I'm not sure what happened here, do only good stacks sound alike and are budget ifi products just bad? Is Sinad more important than I thought?

 Anybody with thought or similar experiences wants to weigh in?

headphones,"Safe levels approximation / reference without measuring tools Hi guys, been researching on safe levels of listening and that got me thinking what levels do I approximately listen to. Doesn't have to be perfect but an approximate. I think we can calculate that by knowing the sensitivity, impedance of the headphone and power output of the dac/amp but I am not sure. Some calculators online give how much power is needed to power a headphone by giving headphone impedance and sensitivity as input but when searching e10k which I am using there isn't a chart that shows how much voltage e10k outputs at all levels of volume Knob.

Basically I am confused how to go about this. I am using 900 pro x and e10k and I want to know what is approximately 85db of sound through it.

Is there any easier to understand calculation that we can do? Is or are there any everyday sounds which we can produce and compare to side by side for an approximation?

headphones,"Why does my AMP/DAC sound significantly worse on my iPhone vs iPad Pro? I recently purchased a Hidisz DH80S AMP/DAC, but it sounds significantly worse on my iPhone XR vs my 10.5” iPad Pro. It’s way more congested on my phone with less detail/separation and soundstage overall. 

At first I thought this was because my iPad Pro can push more power, however, power draw shouldn’t be an issue since the DH80S is battery powered, thus it does not need to rely on the power from the iPhone or iPad. So since the DH80S is using the power from its built in battery there shouldn’t be any differences due to difference in power draw right? But there is, and by a lot.

headphones,"Five things I don't like about the Hifiman Ananda, and why I'm going to keep it anyway One year ago I bought my first open-back headphones, a Sennheiser HD560S. They brought new life and depth to my music, but unfortunately I get tired of listening to them easily. I am fairly treble-sensitive and they have a bit of a treble spike.

The Ananda came with high praise as a timeless headphone from all sources. When I saw a good deal on them, I pulled the trigger a little too quickly. As I continued to browse reviews while they were in the mail I started to doubt my decision, as some of the things I talk about below were briefly mentioned.

Now that it's here and I've had a chance to examine it, there are a lot of things I don't like about the Ananda, in ascending order of annoyance:

1. It has a dip in its subbass frequencies. This is much less noticeable than I expected and it barely bothers me.
2. The included cables are a weird mixed bag of quality. The connectors to the headphones look good enough. The connector at the device end is excellent, made fully of metal and able to rotate freely while the plug stays still in the outlet. But the cable itself is coated in a ribbed, translucent rubber that reminds me of kelp or bamboo. You can see the copper inside through it, and you can feel the innards shifting around when you pinch it.
3. Vocals are significantly recessed. Not a big deal, I can get used to it, but I prefer a balanced signature. Subjectively, I find that male vocals sound better than female vocals. Kanye West's ""Jail"" had a sublimely clear and airy feel that recreated my first awestruck experiences with hi-fi audio.
4. Comfort compared to the 560S is a downgrade. The earpads are pure luxury but at some angles it starts to hurt my head.
5. They have a pronounced sibilant treble spike even worse than the 560S. The first song I listen to with a new pair of headphones is always ""Compass"" by Lady A. When I heard the ""s"" in the first line ""Yeah it'**s** been a bumpy road"", I winced and almost ripped them off and returned them right then. In the chorus, even some of Hillary Scott's vowels verged into sibilance.

Why am I going to keep them in spite of all this? Because holy cow, their soundstage and detail retrieval are insane. I heard new details in songs I'd listened to a dozen times with my 560S. If I pass my hand two inches from the edge of the headphone, I can hear the sound quality drop; it is that wide.

In summary: I personally shouldn't have bought these headphones. But I think other people would enjoy them. I don't like to buy new cables, but maybe you're OK with that. I might get headaches from the strap, but I'm bald and a person with hair to cushion the strap might not have that problem. Maybe you like your headphone to have recessed vocals and/or a treble spike. As with many things in audio, it's all subjective.",five thing hifiman ananda going keep anyway year ago bought first open back headphone sennheiser hd brought life depth music unfortunately tired listening easily fairly treble sensitive bit treble spike ananda came high praise timeless headphone source saw deal pulled trigger little quickly continued browse review mail started doubt decision thing talk briefly mentioned chance examine lot thing ananda ascending order annoyance dip subbass frequency much le noticeable expected barely bother included cable weird mixed bag quality connector headphone look enough connector device end excellent made fully metal able rotate freely plug stay still outlet cable coated ribbed translucent rubber reminds kelp bamboo see copper inside feel innards shifting around pinch vocal significantly recessed big deal used prefer balanced signature subjectively find male vocal sound female vocal kanye west jail sublimely clear airy feel recreated first awestruck experience hi fi audio comfort compared downgrade earpads pure luxury angle start hurt head pronounced sibilant treble spike even worse first song listen pair headphone always compass lady heard first line yeah bumpy road winced almost ripped returned right chorus even hillary scott vowel verged sibilance going keep spite holy cow soundstage detail retrieval insane heard detail song listened dozen time pas hand two inch edge headphone hear sound quality drop wide summary personally bought headphone think people enjoy buy cable maybe ok might headache strap bald person hair cushion strap might problem maybe headphone recessed vocal treble spike many thing audio subjective

I remember that in the past I had a pair of earphones which had a microphone built in to the lead and had a 4 pin TRRS 3.5mm plug.  I had to cut the plug off and put a standard 3 pole TRS 3.5mm plug on as they didnt work with my cheap and cheerful Benjie S5 player.  I guess the socket was shorting out 2 of the pins on the 4 pin TRRS jack plug.

Is that unusual or are a lot of players incompatible with 4 pin TRRS Mic+Heaphone plugs?

I have 2 phones and they are both fine with either TRRS or TRS, but the Benjie loses a channel with TRSS.

The product info pages of the players don't seem to mention this in their specs.

headphones,"My impressions of various £50~200 headphones: MDR-10RC, X2HR, DT770, Roland RH-A-30, HD598 + others. Sorry if this appears to be an aimless post with zero point, but I thought I'd just give my long term impressions of various headphones that I've used throughout the many years I've been into audio listening and production. All of them are around the £50-200 range so nothing here is earth shattering in price, and the main reason why I've yet to really spend a lot on ""the one"" for me is simply because I just don't really know exactly what I want yet. I've switched between liking headphones and wanting to get rid of them in a space of a day because a quirk or ""issue"" props up during work or listening.


**Sony MDR-10RC**

One of the first headphones I used a lot was actually the Sony MDR-10RC headphones, mainly because I was able to grab them for super cheap a couple years back when I was a broke student - like £25 new. They're on-ear and were really easy to carry around, and the sound was surprisingly good. Yeah, it has that overly inflated bass response, and since the design of the headphones couldn't create a great seal around my ears it mostly just meant that it all felt really mushed together, it wasn't very punchy or deep. The treble and low mid range had some dips creating a bit of a darker sound in a few tracks (and especially noticable on waveforms and synths), but hey! For the price I paid I really cannot complain at all - they were put through hell for years and have basically evaporated at this point - it's really loose fitting and the earcups are beyond destroyed. Also, replacement earpads will cost me as much as what I paid for the entire thing!

**Audio Technica M50x**

I got these as a recommendation from a friend from university, I demo'd his pair with a quick track that was on my workstation at the time and they sounded like enhanced versions of the MDR-10RC, so I got them as I was already used to the bassy sound but now the extra treble made things sound more sparkly - cool!

When I got my pair and demo'd a lot more of the tracks I typically listen to, I did enjoy that the treble was far more pronounced but I didn't like the bass or mids as much as I thought I would. It's a similar problem to the 10RC, but with an even more closed in and intense sound (due to the pads and grip?), and the biggest issue of them all likely because of that - they were so painful. My ears wanted to fall off after an hour of using them.

I paid more than 4x the price compared to my MDR-10RC and I found myself not wanting to use them due to the lack of comfort so in the end I just decided to return them. I don't think they were exactly bad sounding at all and they do sound better than the 10RC - it was mostly the comfort that ruined it for me.

**Beyer DT770 80ohm**

These headphones are interesting. I got them shortly after the M50x and my honest first impressions was that I didn't like the bass after being used to the 10RC/M50. Also, everything sounded quite harsh and sibilant (especially on flutes and voice), but I decided that I'm absolutely sticking with these as they were incredibly comfortable and they didn't have that fatiguing boomy, closed in sound that made a lot of songs a bit uncomfortable to listen to - especially if the producers decide to crank the bass way too much already in the mix!

What's really funny is that within a week of using them all of a sudden the bass felt way stronger - too strong! - it was actually offputting and made me look into EQ software for my interface to get back to what I was used to.

I ""balanced"" it to reduce the sibilance and lower the bass to make it more flat sounding and stuck with that for months and gradually enjoyed the sound far more and more until I couldn't have it any other way, at least... I thought I did, until I realized that for the last couple weeks the bloody EQ program wasn't even working as I plugged the interface in another USB port at some point. It was then I realized that I just need to get used to things more as opposed to messing with them for weeks on end - in all, the DT770's sound great. They definitely can be sibilant but I don't mind that at all, and I'd say that the bass is slightly emphasized and the mids are good but certainly not aggressive. I actually still have these to this day.

**Sennheiser HD598**

My first open headphones. To cut straight to the point, I liked them a lot except for that emphasized high-bass that made a lot of low frequency instruments sound strangely resonsant. It threw me off a lot when working with audio and some songs that had an emphasis on punchy, mid-forward bass sounded like they were playing in a small, reflective room. At first I thought it was just revealing a bad mix but I had that ""damn it"" moment when taking a few projects into a studio with a good monitoring system - what sounded punchy just sounded boxy on the headphones, and balancing sound with the HD598 made me reduce the low mids too much to compensate, it was a frustrating thing. I liked everything else about it but that one problem kept bothering me too much that I sold them and went back to the DT770.

Shame, because the sound stage? Nice! Comfort? Excellent! And it had detachable cables!


**Roland RH-300**

I got these cheap and I'm a bit of a Roland hardware mark so I couldn't resist. Anyway, you can have a look at them and realize they're basically just Audio Technica M50's but with a few different things here and there, and it does change the sound quite considerably. Compared to the M50x I'd say that the RH-300 has less boomy bass but far more recessed treble and more forward mids, so you pretty much just get a flatter, darker sounding version of the M50. Are they bad? Nope, I actually enjoy the sound! They work wonders with a few tracks, especially a lot of indie rock where you want that close, in-your-face punchy sound. However, I can't use them much because just like the M50x, they make me ears want to fall off and run away after about an hour of use. I've bought some replacement pads of different materials but it just makes them sound worse.

**Philips Fidelio X2HR**

To prevent me from turning into a closed-back-only club after selling my HD598, I got these.  I like them... I think. I'm actually not too sure anymore and I don't even know how to explain it properly. It's almost as though you're listening to music from a couple steps away from a speaker than you're expected to? All of the sound is there, there's nothing obviously wrong or harshly imbalanced, but it's almost as though you're hearing some kind of distant, reflective resonance at all times that makes a lot of the sound bleed into each other that messes with the attack and presence of a lot of instruments in a song. It's *really* nitpicky, I know, and what I'm talking about is not noticable unless you compare it with other sound sources. The build quality is great, the comfort is fantastic and I think they look really cool.

I'm not entirely sure what to think of them at the moment, or if I'll keep using them. I gave them multiple weeks and... I'm still unsure.

**Roland RH-A30**

Again, they look like they were based off the M50's, but these ones are open-backs and built a little nicer than the RH-300. Hey, you ask, why would you buy this when they destroy your ears? Well, this one is slightly bigger and actually has these nice, fat velour pads! They don't ruin my ears!

I've only had these for a few weeks now and if I was to describe the sound I'd say it's not as distant or blurry as the X2HR, it has more treble than the RH-300 but it isn't piercing, it's not as bassy or sibilant as the DT770 but if there's one thing that's clear, it's that the mids are very forward and can be quite aggressive. They make my X2HR's sound mid-scooped. It seems to be mostly flat with a very slight push in the low mids and 10k range. It makes snare drums, electric guitars, vocals and flutes stand out a lot. The soundstage isn't as distant as the HD598 but it isn't closed in either. Build quality is not as good at the X2HR, they make creaky noises if you move a lot, and it has no detachable cable which sucks, but I took a chance on these and I'm pretty surprised at how much I'm enjoying them, which also makes me realize that I'm someone that seems to prefer more mids and treble compared to bass in their headphones, which was quite a reversal from when my journal started.

I don't know if anyone read all of that, but I hope my rambling brought any kind of interest to you if I did take up your time. Just for a bonus, I'll post my uh, taste in songs that I demo headphones with. At least, the ones that I can even find online!


[Sword of Justice - Beyond the Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsJtKXsQTf8)

Metal warning - loud! Super aggressive mid-focused guitars, punchy lows, bright female vocals and sharp synths/harpsichords. This song can easily sound wrong if you have headphones that boost bass, scoop the mids or mess with the treble too much. The X2HR brings out the sub bass too much, makes the harpsichord sound blurred and takes the vocals back a little, the DT770 sounds great and is the least fatiguing to listen to and the while the RH-A30 sounds very balanced, the forward mids can make the song sound very aggressive.

[Chirinuruwowaka - Milk-iro no Touge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjPTGNNgFYA)

Very sharp sounding mids on this song and a lot of frequencies in that ""boxy"" bass range due to the bass tone and percussion. Some headphones that dial back the mids make the vocals and guitars sound mushed together since they're mixed so close. The HD598 made the drums and bass sound way too resonant and boxy. The DT770 and RH-A30 sound best.

[Unmei wa Utsukushiku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_LOcDbkf8)

What?! Okay, depending on the headphones, if they lack detail in the low mids or have rollercoaster treble, it can make the vocals feel like they're vieled back and too bright while the other instruments just overtake her. The song sounds badly balanced on the X2HR, a bit too thin on the DT770 but sounds pretty good on the HD598 and RH-A30.

[Ken Nagakawa - A Rusted Neigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0BgHEOruek)

It's a very percussive song with a deep bass, lots of atmospheric pads and a flute lead. The X2HR brings out the bass but it actually sounds quite nice at first as it doesn't take much away from the lead... the only problem is after the 1:00 mark, it just sounds a little too V shaped as it's emphasizing the thumping bass and leads too much. The DT770 and RH-A30 sound completely fine here.

headphones,"Kz Edx pros have a weird sound Hi, I just got the KZ edx pro today after seeing multiple reviews by many people including DankPods and ppl as such saying that these have amazing audio for the price.

However, I feel that my units may have an issue or maybe Ive installed them wrongly? They seem to have okay bass but treble is tinny and weird, sound isn't very clear and I guess I would refer to it as flat? This is in comparison to my old earpieces that costed about the same price.

For some information, I'm using them on a Samsung S10+'s headphone jack and have turned off all audio post processing except for UHQ upscaling which there no option to. I'm listening to music in tidal.

I'm a first time user of iems but I don't reckon they should sound like how I described them right?

headphones,"DAC amp for Android? X2hr I know this has been asked a lot and I've been reading lots on Reddit and other forums but I need some help because there is a lot of conflicting information out there.

So I just bought myself a pair of X2hr headphones and I really like them.  Unfortunately they don't sound great when I use them with my Samsung S10+.  Using the headphone jack they just sound fine.  Much better when I plug them into the headphone output of my reciever.  I don't have a dedicated headphone amp.  I don't have a dedicated DAC.  I'm on a budget and I want something that will make listening on my phone a better experience.

So I looked at a number of DAC amp combos and man, there is just way to much out there. Not to mention usually to expensive.  I want something portable, and under 50 bucks.

I have heard good things about the sound quality from the apple USB c dongle but I have also heard it doesn't work great with Android. But it's very cheap and extremely portable.  Any one able to share there experience with it?

Are there any other dongle type DAC amps that are of good quality that work well with Android? Again under about 50.  Small budget I know but it's what I can afford right now.

Or would I be better to just forget portability and get something larger?  I really just want something to power my headphones when I'm laying around doing school work.  But having something portable seems like a plus!

headphones,"Getting headphones/headset for ""free"" Hello!  
I work in a sales position where we can report our sales to a vendor and get some “points”, the points can be used in a virtual store to buy stuff. I want to spend some of them on a new headphone/headset.  
I have made a list of all the available headsets and headphones I can choose from.   
I currently have some old Steelseries Siberia V2 that have broken 2-3 times but I have soldered them, added new wires, etc. and fixed them every time. I think I would like to be able to fix my new headphones in the future once/if they break, I’m not the type to change things often. I’ve had the old ones for maybe 7-8 years currently, and I wouldn’t change them if it wasn’t for the points and the fact I could get a new one for free basically.

I found out I could “cheese” the points system a bit by buying gift cards at a store through the rewards program and get access to more headphones. I will list these separately, and if possible would like to get recommendations from both lists.  
Here’s the lists of what I can pick from, which ones would you guys recommend?  


**Points/rewards headphones:** [**https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz\_gRlcwKDFhjDPDRa-Tze40FoyTj9f0yCCeGbQbj78/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz_gRlcwKDFhjDPDRa-Tze40FoyTj9f0yCCeGbQbj78/edit?usp=sharing)   
**Gift card audio store:** [**https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JBm2Z49B9gFkumdK5ezM1OQQWFwX25bJKmvpM9UsxU/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JBm2Z49B9gFkumdK5ezM1OQQWFwX25bJKmvpM9UsxU/edit?usp=sharing)   


* **Budget** \- N/A (But for the ones listed under “Gift Card Audio Store” in my list I want to keep it around 4200 NOK (around 500 USD) or below to not spend all my points.
* **Source** \- Plugging them into my PC, but might get a DAC or amp if it’s highly recommended and I can find one in the “rewards store” or an associated gift card shop.
* **Requirements for Isolation** \- I don’t think I want open back as it might annoy the other people in the house, I never close the door to where I sit, as I often talk/yell to people in other rooms and they do the same to me. I might also want to be able to hear a bit while wearing them, I like hearing my own voice a bit when I talk (otherwise i often talk too loud).
* **Will you be using these Headphones in Public?** No I will not.
* **Preferred Type of Headphone** \- Full sized, will use them mainly for playing video games while voice chatting with people. side-usage = voice calls and listening to music.
* **Preferred tonal balance** \- Not sure, probably balanced? will mainly use them for gaming and some music listening and voice calls.
* **Past headphones** \- Had Steelseries Siberia V2 before and some others I forgot. They were OK, but I think I prefer foam pads over fake leather as it can get sweaty and clampy sometimes, but this is not that big of a deal as long as they are comfortable.
* **Preferred Music** \- Rock, metal,synthwave mostly (I listen to stuff from pop to death metal, mainly more “hard” stuff though) but I think this is irrelevant for my usage.
* **What would you like to improve on from your set-up** \- Something High-end that is good for gaming mostly and audio-positioning in games, better sound and more comfortable to wear.
* **Country:** Norway, but I think this is irrelevant as I have to pick from a list.
* **Most important features for me:** Must be comfortable and have good sound quality (most important of all)**,** I often use my headphones in a long sitting.Must work with PC. Should be great for gaming (mainly for FPS audio positioning). The mic only needs to be average and above.
* **Other preferences: 1.** Would prefer audio jacks, not USB. **2.** Would also prefer wired and not wireless. **3.** Think I would prefer foam pads or something similar instead of the fake leather. **4.** Might prefer closed back, or is the sound leakage not that high?.  **5.** Might prefer the headset to have a microphone, but I can also get one separately if it’s available through the points/rewards program. NOTE: If a headset is vastly superior to another, then these preferences can be ignored.

**Notes: 1.** I am fine with buying a separate mic if I can find it through the rewards or gift card program. **2.** I am also OK with buying a DAC/separate audio card if I can get one through the rewards or gift program. I currently do not have a DAC or an amp. I plug the headphones directly into the front plugs of my PC usually.

SHP9500  
My daily driver for 5 years now. It was a gift from my audiophile friend. Neutral to bright. Widest of the bunch. Quite exiting, blend things quite well which also makes them bad at instrument separation and layering. It struggles with busy tracks. It's got airy-ness to it, which makes it nice to listen to jazz, classical, and acoustic tracks. Can be shouty and sibilant at times. If I were to upgrade, I'd probably go for 560S, waiting for the pads to wither away. Main reason for daily drive is it's not fussy, no charging and no trying to untangle the cable from the headphone (unlike IEM's)

MDR-1000X  
My go to portable audio. Bought used for 2 mil IDR (122 EUR, take that yanks!). Had it not sounding different (worse) through wire and has to rely on the bats, I'd probably use them more on desktop. It sounds chill. While yes it is V-shaped with warm tilt I rarely carve for the mids to be more forward. Soundstage is wider than something like ATH-M series. It's detailed enough to surprise me from time to time. I see a lot of people lately shite on the XM4 and 3, from anecdote I think sony's trying to have the audiophile community approval  and then slowly muddying it up by bloating the bass to appeal to the normies (tinfoil hat stuff this).

Tin T2  
I lost it about 1-2 years ago. People called it neutral, but I thought it was neutral-bright and this is coming from someone who daily drive SHP. Maybe because it was in ear? It was the first time I heard an open sounding IEM. I like it being top down, but I despise the cable. Phone nowdays are tall, if I pocket them with T2 cable plugged I can't sit. It has too much of the grippy bit  and too little strain relief. It's a easy to drive IEM, don't pretend that it's a hard to drive heavy duty hifi equipment. Also both earpiece and cable starts to loosen after 1 year. I know this because I test it with someone else's IEM.

KZ ZSN Pro X  
Honestly, I'd rather the samsung earphone that came with S series and up (was it?). I prefer cable down ones, the over ear cable rarely fit me comfortably. Then there's the sound V shape, not the chill one at that. It sounds like it's trying hard to give you a 'clear' sound. And I constantly miss the mids. It sounds like the mic used for recording been covered by layers of thick windshield and pop filters. The bass well extended, the mids although too recessed honestly is fine, but the treble is gritty. Also it somewhat sounds artificial, maybe because it's timbre issue. Overall it sounds fine, a decent starter perhaps.

Next is Quarks, it's on the way.

headphones,"DT 1990 Pro -&gt; Focal Clear: A non-audiophile impression   

INTRO: Hi guys! I recently hopped on the $990 Focal Clear train on Headphones.com like many others here. Took me a couple sleepless night before making the purchase especially since it was not only my first kilobuck headphones but also a final sale item. What essentially pushed me to do it were 1) They’re about to be discontinued, so the resale value should be pretty stable in the future 2) They have amazing reviews and just simply look gorgeous. 3) Upgraditis lol

Anyway, I’ve been using a DT 1990 pro for the past several months (and absolutely loving them), and I’ve decided to write a comparison between the two since both of them are highly popular headphones. Like the title said, I’m not an audiophile by any means, and will therefore avoid professional jargons and terms. If you want professional reviews there are plenty to be found on YouTube.

***Short Preface:*** 

The DT 1990 pro I’m using are with the Dekoni Velour Pads. Plenty have been written about them already, so I don’t think I need to elaborate on how they affect the sound compared to the stock pads. I’m also using a Schitt stack (Modi 3+ &amp; Magni 3+) to drive them.

I’ll also compare the two headphones in terms of their stock sounds AND after EQ, since I find it more interesting (and fairer) to compare two headphones once they have the similar sound signatures. I applied Oratory EQ for both headphones since those EQ values are supposed to produce very similar sound signatures. 

Let’s go!

***SOUND:***

**BASS-**

STOCK SOUND:

Very similar between the two to my ears. If you like bass both of these headphones will satisfy your need without questions. Clear maybe hits SLIGHTLY deeper than the DT 1990, but both are clean and impactful. I mainly listen to Angel by Massive Attack to test them.

**DT 1990 = Focal Clear**

AFTER EQ:

Very interesting result. After EQ, DT 1990’s bass is elevated. They hit deeper, harder…but also noticeably muddier. It still feels clean and impactful compared to 99% of the headphones in that price range, but compared to the Clear…the Clear hit as deep, as hard, and STILL maintain the speed and the crispiness. In fact I even turned up the bass several DB higher, and amazed at just how clean the Clear’s bass response is.

So, without EQ, the bass between the two are quite similar. After EQ, Clear has better and cleaner bass for sure.

**Focal Clear &gt; DT 1990** 

   
 

**MID:**

STOCK SOUND:

Clear has better mid, period. DT 1990’s mid feels recessed in comparison. Clear feels A LITTLE shouty at times, and every now and then I did hear the “metallic” quality that some people have been referring to. That only bothered me in the very beginning when I was still used to the DT 1990’s more laidback vocal.

**Focal Clear &gt; DT 1990** 

AFTER EQ:

Clear wins hands down. DT 1990, despite the EQ, still feels recessed. In fact they don’t just feel recessed, but THINNER. I had to turn up the mid (for some reason the Oratory EQ turned down the mid instead) a few DB to get the sound that I like. Clear, on the other hand, fixed all my problem with the mid after EQ. 

**Focal Clear &gt; DT 1990** 

   
 

**TREBLE**

STOCK SOUND:

Now, this will be controversial. To start off, I LOVE DT 1990’S treble (again, I’m using the Dekoni Velour pads). I was raised playing multiple instruments including violin, and the treble on the DT 1990 create the best violin sound I’ve ever heard on any headphones, period. Yes, they do get sibilant every now and then whether in music or in spoken words, but to me it’s a fair trade off.

Clear’s treble underwhelmed me. Compared to DT 1990 they feel recessed, and instruments just sound boring. Yes, I understand that to some people Clear already has a pronounced treble, and if you’re one of those people who absolutely cannot tolerate DT 1990 treble, then I figure Clear will be just the right amount for you. For me, DT 1990 win the round.

**DT 1990 &gt; Focal Clear**

AFTER EQ

This becomes a much fairer match after EQ. The Clear finally has that sparkles that I’m looking for, and become much better headphones instead. Similarly, after EQing the treble down on the DT 1990, they still maintain the amazing sound of the instruments, but without the sibilance. 

Frankly, I MIGHT still pick the DT 1990 for treble even after EQ, but only ever so slightly. The violins just…sound SOOO good on them. Objectively, I’ll rate them both the same.

**DT 1990 = Focal Clear**

   
 

**Soundstage &amp; Imaging…and other audiophile jargons**

So I’m not great at hearing and describing “imaging” or “soundstage,” I can only describe what I hear and feel instead. 

Frankly, this is the one area where DT 1990 wins out for me, and sadly, this is also the only area that EQ can’t fix. Again, growing up playing many instruments (I was in concert band, orchestra, jazz band, marching band, everything you can think of), DT 1990 are the first pair of headphones that actually allow me to hear so many different instruments and pinpoint where they are in separation. (I guess this is what the audiophiles call “instrument separation”)

I don’t know if Clear sound “intimate” like many other reviewers have said, but they do sound less wide with less depth than the DT 1990. The instruments DO feel crammed together compared to the DT 1990, and it took away some of the enjoyment while listening to music since I greatly enjoy picking out different instruments in a song. 

This makes DT 1990 better for video games and movies where you kinda want sound to come in from each direction for immersion and precision. 

After listening to DT 1990 for months, it took me a couple days to get used to the smaller and shallower soundstage of the Clear, and honestly, I might’ve returned them if I could’ve at that point. Now, I sort of enjoy…or more like ACQUIRED the taste of the smaller stage of Clear. But again, if what you LOVE about the DT 1990 are the instrument separation and the depth of the soundstage, Focal Clear are much inferior in those aspects.

**DT 1990 &gt; Focal Clear**

   
 

**TL:DR**

Both headphones have their strengths and weaknesses. Focal Clear, as a whole, SOUND better in pretty much every aspect, especially after EQ. DT 1990, however, win for me in terms of soundstage and instrument separation. DT 1990 are still an amazing pair of headphones, and Clear are definitely not twice as good as them…but hey, this hobby is all about diminishing returns, ain’t it? 

At the end of the day, **I found DT 1990 more fun in picking out instruments and better for games and movies. The Clear are better for general music enjoyment and impact.**",dt pro focal clear non audiophile impression intro hi guy recently hopped focal clear train headphone many others took couple sleepless night making purchase especially since first kilobuck headphone final sale item essentially pushed discontinued resale value pretty stable future amazing review simply look gorgeous upgraditis lol anyway using dt pro past several month absolutely loving decided write comparison two since highly popular headphone title said audiophile mean therefore avoid professional jargon term want professional review plenty found youtube short preface dt pro using dekoni velour pad plenty written already think need elaborate affect sound compared stock pad using schitt stack modi magni drive compare two headphone term stock sound eq since find interesting fairer compare two headphone similar sound signature applied oratory eq headphone since eq value supposed produce similar sound signature let go sound bass stock sound similar two ear bass headphone satisfy need without question clear maybe hit slightly deeper dt clean impactful mainly listen angel massive attack test dt focal clear eq interesting result eq dt bass elevated hit deeper harder noticeably muddier still feel clean impactful compared headphone price range compared clear clear hit deep hard still maintain speed crispiness fact even turned bass several db higher amazed clean clear bass response without eq bass two quite similar eq clear cleaner bass sure focal clear dt mid stock sound clear mid period dt mid feel recessed comparison clear feel little shouty time every hear metallic quality people referring bothered beginning still used dt laidback vocal focal clear dt eq clear win hand dt despite eq still feel recessed fact feel recessed thinner turn mid reason oratory eq turned mid instead db sound clear hand fixed problem mid eq focal clear dt treble stock sound controversial start love dt treble using dekoni velour pad raised playing multiple instrument including violin treble dt create best violin sound ever heard headphone period yes sibilant every whether music spoken word fair trade clear treble underwhelmed compared dt feel recessed instrument sound boring yes understand people clear already pronounced treble people absolutely cannot tolerate dt treble figure clear right amount dt win round dt focal clear eq becomes much fairer match eq clear finally sparkle become much headphone instead similarly eqing treble dt still maintain amazing sound instrument without sibilance frankly might still pick dt treble even eq ever slightly violin sound sooo objectively rate dt focal clear soundstage imaging audiophile jargon great hearing describing imaging soundstage describe hear feel instead frankly area dt win sadly area eq fix growing playing many instrument concert band orchestra jazz band marching band everything think dt first pair headphone actually allow hear many different instrument pinpoint separation guess audiophiles call instrument separation clear sound intimate many reviewer said sound le wide le depth dt instrument feel crammed together compared dt took away enjoyment listening music since greatly enjoy picking different instrument song make dt video game movie kinda want sound come direction immersion precision listening dt month took couple day used smaller shallower soundstage clear honestly might returned could point sort enjoy acquired taste smaller stage clear love dt instrument separation depth soundstage focal clear much inferior aspect dt focal clear tl dr headphone strength weakness focal clear whole sound pretty much every aspect especially eq dt however win term soundstage instrument separation dt still amazing pair headphone clear definitely twice hey hobby diminishing return end day found dt fun picking instrument game movie clear general music enjoyment impact

headphones,"DAC/AMP for Hifiman Sundara Hi!  


I recently picked up a pair of Hifiman's Sundara headphones.  
Until now I have been using a Focusrite Scarlett Solor interface with my m50xs, but I would like to upgrade there along with the headphones. 

What would you recommend in terms of DAC/AMP configurations for these headphones?  
Two concerns I have is that I am using an XLR microphone now, so I would need something that has an XLR mic in, and also balanced 6.5mm outputs for my speakers.

I looked at the Schiit stack but then I would lose the XLR mic input and it only has RCA outputs for speakers afaik.",dac amp hifiman sundara hi recently picked pair hifiman sundara headphone using focusrite scarlett solor interface x upgrade along headphone recommend term dac amp configuration headphone two concern using xlr microphone need something xlr mic balanced mm output speaker looked schiit stack lose xlr mic input rca output speaker afaik

headphones,"Another 6xx disappointment post.. So i just received them few minutes ago,

i plug it to my amp fiio e10k then new released fiio ka3, and i started to questioning the people in this hobby,

i know sound is subjective but this sound is way too muddy for me, the mid is ok, it missing a lot of detail/treble and the high is too extended. Bass is not pronounced, it sound too spread, it lack thump but at the same time it make it sound muddy, i say it have more high bass than mid bass.

i daily drive denon d2000, and guess what denon sound way open despite it being a closed back. Denon sound bassy too but its not overly muddy like 6xx, the mid sound more organic and lifelike, the treble have slightly detail than 6xx, the high is better.

how the heck open back sound so closed than closed back.

i have few earbud too, and i use totl earbud Shozy Bk/Stardust for sleeping, shozy beat hd6xx by large margin, way more detail, more treble/high, way more natural mids, the only weakness of shozy is the bass and soundstage. The Faeal Rosemary 120 ohm have more soundstage than 6xx, wth that is earbud you know.

i don't know why some people say it need powerful amp to unleash it's potential, i only use 10% of rotary knob on the amp and it sound loud enough to me (i bet i must be one of the people who listen on low volume level) the point is i don't think the amp is the problem, even if i upgrade to more expensive amp i don't think it will appeal enough to me.

i will give it a listen for a few day i guess, maybe this is just reaction from the first listen,

i will give it a chance, maybe i'm not audiophile enough and cannot fathom this sound.

i feel that i expected it to be more than it suppose to be, based on the rave reviews and how people treat it like goldmine in audio world.

i should have gone with Sundara instead.

Do i regret the purchase? nope, because it i got it used with a great price in a great condition, basically new. (maybe the ex owner regret the purchase too) i can give this to my sibling.

headphones,"Can't hear the difference between iFi Hip dac and MBA headphone out Hi, so i've recently bought a pair of HD660S headphones and instantly heard a big difference over my previous most used pair (ATH-M50X) that they've mostly made redundant. To get the best out of them then, or so I expected would make a difference to the quality of the sound, I purchased the hip daq and was instantly underwhelmed with it's performance as there's no real noticable difference between the dac in that and the MBA headphone out. I tried lots of back to back with tracks I know well and I can't hear any difference in dynamics or instrumentation detail, so i'm really baffled and disappointed.

I can certainly crank the headphones up to deafening levels now and the bass boost works, but the extra detail and dynamics is missing

Is this a faulty unit then, or is a dac a case of the Emperors New Clothes and there's no noticable difference, at least at this lower end of the market using flacs and mp3?",hear difference ifi hip dac mba headphone hi recently bought pair hd headphone instantly heard big difference previous used pair ath mostly made redundant best expected make difference quality sound purchased hip daq instantly underwhelmed performance real noticable difference dac mba headphone tried lot back back track well hear difference dynamic instrumentation detail baffled disappointed certainly crank headphone deafening level bass boost work extra detail dynamic missing faulty unit dac case emperor clothes noticable difference least lower end market using flacs mp

headphones,"Why Do People Claim Openback is Better For Gaming? I can't reply on the threads I want cause they are like 7 years old but people really be saying Openback is better because of the ""soundstage"" which imo is a vague reasoning behind the claim. I'm gonna break it down how my mind perceives open and closedback. 

For starters, what is a soundstage? Soundstages allow you to have perception of sounds without visuals (basically). Your ability to perceive where and what is making a certain noise. Openback headsets allow for sound leakage and for ambient noise to enter your ear. So with sound leaking out and ambient noise leaking in how is the user given a superior soundstage when compared to it's closedback counterpart? 

Closedback block out your ambient noise and keep all your sounds contained inside your ear, allowing for much better sound accuracy and better sound information. With the sound not leaking out of the muff, you can get all the information you need without hearing your neighbor mow his damn lawn. 

For a gaming environment, you want to be able to hear everything, but accurately. I can't make sense on being able to aquire accurate sound information if you have sounds leaking in and out of the headset. 

The one counter argument I see people use is echo (I only see studio heads use this argument) and how sounds can bounce around inside the earmuff. I've been daily driving a 250ohm (high pressure) closedback headset and have only ran into that echo issue if the cans are MAXED tf out 100% volume. But if you are maxing out a closedback headset I think you might need some hearing aids.

For $20, I experienced not a single disconnection. No issues on pairing. The battery is superb at 20 hrs I think. I haven't even drained it yet. I will never go back to TWS lol.

The sound quality is pretty much the same as wired. Very little diffence. The APTX is awesome. I am using KZ EDX. 

It looks good too and doesn't feel cheap. The comfort is great. It has this band so they wont slip over your neck. Though the earhooks are subpar.

The controls are great addition. Though phone audio wont be adjusted when no audio is playing on phone. Not a big issue anyway. 

Yes there is indeed latency but it's decent. I can do my transcription job fine.

The only thing I hate about it is the beep sound when you  mute your device or go max volume.

headphones,"AutoEQ Question Forgive me if I make any mistakes with what I'm saying here. Because, I'm still trying to figure this out.

I was able to finally get the AutoEQ cmd thing to work and generate my own headphones conversions. From what I understand, sans the input and output directories, I have to use ""compensation="" if I'm to convert my headphones to sound like the Harman Target or diffused field or etc. And if I were to convert my headphones to another one (say, SHP 9500 to HD560s), I just use ""sound\_signature="" after the ""compensation="" (and bass\_boost=4) and it will add the sound signature of the target headphone on the compensation. Ok, got it.

Now, here's the question: Why can't I just skip the ""sound\_signature="" all together and just directly input it in the ""compensation="" (and remove bass boost) if compensation is basically just tuning it to—what is essentially—another signature? 

Like, instead of:

    --compensation=""measurements\rtings\resources\rtings_harman_over-ear_2018_wo_bass.csv"" --sound_signature=""measurements\rtings\data\onear\Sennheiser HD 560S\Sennheiser HD 560S.csv""

...why can't I just go and do:

    --compensation=""measurements\rtings\data\onear\Sennheiser HD 560S\Sennheiser HD 560S.csv""

Yes, I have tried both and have generated their results:

Long story short, while low-bass seems to be practically similar, the mid-bass to mid-mid is lower on the 1st test than on the 2nd test (disregard the treble, for now).

Also, I checked the frequency responses of each headphones. The mids are almost similar. So, theoretically speaking, the ""valley"" on the 1st method should not exist and should be something similar to the 2nd method. But I feel like I'm doing something wrong here.

headphones,"HE400SE (China ver.) first impressions [vs. SHP9500] Just got my HE400se today. I wanted to try planar headphones and saw these for sale in our local e-commerce site for around $90 (converted). My old headphones are the SHP9500 which I've owned for around 1 year. Many people will be looking at the same upgrade path so I'll share some impressions and comparisons. 

For some A/B testing, the SHP was powered by an apple dongle connected to a windows PC; the 400SE was powered by a JCALLY JM20 dongle (It gets plenty loud at 30 windows volume). 

Out of the box, the difference between the sound signatures of the two headphones are apparent. The SHPs are bright, the 400se sounds almost laid back compared to the SHPs. The 400se is, hands down, better tuned.

The bass on the two units are also different. The 400se is less punchy but cleaner, the SHPs have a midbass boost so they're a bit punchier. As for extension, the two units are pretty similar. I have yet to hear ""planar bass""

For the mids, the 400se can get a bit recessed in some tracks but not very much. I would not describe the high mids as veiled but it might appear as such if you came from the SHP. The mids on the SHPs are pretty good (at least for me).

For the highs, this is where the cans differ a lot. The SHPs can sound harsh, sibilant, and fatiguing on tracks with plenty of cymbals or high frequency sound effects. The 400se is smoother, with less treble energy, but still provides impressive detail. It's somewhat like the SHPs are forced to produce the highs while the 400se just does it effortlessly. 

For comfort, SHP wins. The 400se's headband is kinda ass, and the extension is pretty short (I maxed out a headphone extension for the first time lol, and I don't really have a big head). The clamp is not too tight. The earpads are comfortable but a little too small for my liking. 

Is it an upgrade? Yes. While the SHPs are not bad (in my opinion) the 400SE is just straight up the more coherently-tuned headphone. If you're thinking about buying either, go for the 400SE.",se china ver first impression v shp got se today wanted try planar headphone saw sale local e commerce site around converted old headphone shp owned around year many people upgrade path share impression comparison b testing shp powered apple dongle connected window pc se powered jcally jm dongle get plenty loud window volume box difference sound signature two headphone apparent shps bright se sound almost laid back compared shps se hand tuned bass two unit different se le punchy cleaner shps midbass boost bit punchier extension two unit pretty similar yet hear planar bass mids se bit recessed track much describe high mids veiled might appear came shp mids shps pretty least high can differ lot shps sound harsh sibilant fatiguing track plenty cymbal high frequency sound effect se smoother le treble energy still provides impressive detail somewhat shps forced produce high se effortlessly comfort shp win se headband kinda as extension pretty short maxed headphone extension first time lol big head clamp tight earpads comfortable little small liking upgrade yes shps bad opinion se straight coherently tuned headphone thinking buying either go se

My gf put one of our cats up on my shoulder while I was sitting at my desk with headphones on and he seemed to have rubbed against the right side of the headphones. Immediately the sound from that side cut out and was replaced with a very low bass sound.

headphones,"Just did a comparison of four closed back headphones, and boy was I surprised Firstly, music is very important to me. I listen in the car, when I'm working, when I'm reading, when I'm working out, when I'm mowing or when I'm just watching the critters in my backyard.


I'm not a music critic, so hopefully what I've written is clear enough. I'm going to keep this somewhat brief.


I've owned the Sennheiser HD280 Pro since 2010, Sennheiser PXC550 since 2018, the Focal Stellia since 12/2021 and the Meze Classics 99 since a week ago. (I also own Sennheiser Momentum TW2, Sennheiser 300CX, Klipsch TY 2, After Shockz Aeropex)


I powered all the headphones through a Qudelix 5k. I tested them on flat EQ as well as using [settings from oratory1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/9o2f5n/psa_oratory1990s_list_of_eq_presets/) All the media was Flac.


I had read so many amazing reviews about the Focal Stellia that I really wanted them. I was really expecting it to surprise me with it's sound. Boy was I disappointed. No matter what I tried (different music, different EQ settings, etc.), I just wasn't impressed with it. So I ordered the Meze Classics 99, which also had amazing reviews. The Meze is 1/10th the price of the Stellia! Right out of the box, the Meze kicked ass. The sound was amazing no matter what I listened to.


I've always loved the HD280's and it was my reference point. Testing it side by side with the Stellia and the Classics 99 actually made me sad because I could tell very clearly that as good as it sounded, it just wasn't in the same class as the Meze Classics 99.


What did I test these cans with?

**NIN:**

Something I can never have

Satellite

Closer

Ghosts (21-24)


**Miles Davis:**

Kind of Blue

Bitches Brew


**The Crystal Method:**

Blowout

High Roller


**Led Zeppelin:**

When the levee breaks

Dazed and Confused


**Beethoven:**

Fidelio, Op. 72, Act 1: No. 9 Abscheulicher! wo eilst du hin

Cello Sonata No. 3 in A major, Op. 69: III. Adagio cantabile - Allegro vivace


**Black Angels:**

Young Men Dead


**Massive Attack:**

Angel

Mezzanine


**Bottomline:**

Which is the best headphone of my collection? **Meze Classics 99.**

I wanted to give the Stellia the benefit of the doubt and say that which headphone won would depend on the kind of music, but I just could not defeat the Meze. It handled that list above with absolute class. The trebles were beautiful, the bass was roomy and large on Massive Attack's Angel and tight on Nine Inch Nail's Ghosts 24. Every instrument on Fidelio was clear, distinct and beautiful. Miles' trumpets made me stop everything I was doing.


I know some of you are going to shake your head and go ""This guy doesn't know what good headphones are."" My conclusion is that if you are able to try cans of such a wide range of quality side by side, you'll be able to tell the difference very quickly. I really didn't think the differences would be so stark, but I was really surprised. And then you just have to pick the one that SOUNDS THE BEST TO YOU!

headphones,"iFi ZEN DAC v2 - disconnecting after while - fix I'm the owner of the mentioned DAC from five days paired with Beyerdynamic DT990 PRO 80 Ohm - they sound way better than my previous Sennheiser PXC 550. But the last two days, I spent figuring out why they're randomly disconnecting from my PC with ubuntu operating system, but it can be applied to other flavours. So I want to share solution what I found, sooner or later someone will fall into this issue. Without further ado, this is the recipe:

The issue is disconnecting DAC/AMP iFi ZEN DAC v2 in random time.

Probably system detect idle run of the hardware and disconnect device. Two place where we can change behaviour for this device is pulse audio configuration and USB system power rules.

The first one:

1. Run in text editor with superuser privileges /etc/pulse/default.pa

i.e. `sudo vim /etc/pulse/default.pa`

&amp;#x200B;

2. Search line responsible for suspending sink or sources

`load-module module-suspend-on-idle`

and remove or comment it with # character

&amp;#x200B;

3. Restart the pulse daemon

`systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service`

&amp;#x200B;

The second:

1. Run in text editor with superuser privileges /etc/udev/rules.d/xx-usb\_power\_save.rules. In my case, the full name of the file is 50-usb\_power\_save.rules but in your case can be any other number.

i.e. `sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb\_power\_save.rules`

&amp;#x200B;

2. If you have any entry looking at this

`ACTION==""add"", SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""xxxx"", ATTR{idProduct}==""xxxx"", GOTO=""power\_usb\_rules\_end""`

provide next one after them, probably it should look like this

`ACTION==""add"", SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""20b1"", ATTR{idProduct}==""3008"", GOTO=""power\_usb\_rules\_end""`

But if you want to be confident about vendor and product ID, run

`lsusb`

and search ""XMOS Ltd iFi (by AMR) HD USB Audio"". You should change this numbers if they are different.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Reload the rules by

`udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; udevadm trigger`

or just restart pc.

headphones,"is $275 dollars for Airpods Max a steal? I just ordered a pair of Airpods Max because I needed a solid pair of wireless over ear headphones. When I visited an apple store, I tried the Airpods Max and I personally fell in love with their sound, quality, and especially comfort. The headphones were so comfortable and the sound was pretty crisp i was really impressed and had my mouth literally gaping open in awe. So after a month or so, I told myself ""screw it"" just find a reasonable one online. I logged on to Depop and I saw this one person selling them for originally $400.  I thought that was good deal since the original price was a whopping $550. Personally I think the Airpods max are not even close to being $550 worth, they're worth 250 at best. I talked the seller down and they were really nice and they said they can do $275! Which is basically half the retail price. I'm one of those who hunt for good deals on anything I purchase so I had to jump on this offer. From the pictures, they're amazing condition for basically brand new Airpods max except its out the plastic wrap.

headphones,"Sony WF-1000XM4 vs. Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Quick In-Store Comparison Review Been wavering between XM4s and L3Ps for a while. Finally got some time to go try them out in the retails few days ago. Here are my thoughts (I am not an audiophile, just your average casual listener):

**Sound Quality**
*Compared without installing app (so no EQ tweaking).
*With the same music source, L3P sounds much more fun, vibrant, more apparent low/mid/high separation to me.
*XM4 sounds more relatively dull, warm, just not as fun. (I understand this could be vastly improved with EQ, but I'm skeptical. There is a huge difference here.)
*For both, if listened independently, both can be considered very good and fun enough.

**Feel in the ears**
*Good stability for both. Could withstand the most violent head-motion.
*XM4 fills the entire ear. Feels very stable, but very stuffy after a while (could imagine if worn for hours I'd sweat in ear). Wouldn't want to wear for extended periods of time, especially during hot weather.
*LP3 feels much lighter and less stuffy, but lots of wiggle-room. Could wear them for more extended periods of time.

**Touch control**
*XM4 feels much more stable/reliable due to its stability in ears. Feels much more premium in tapping.
*L3P feels less reliable in tapping due to the aforementioned wiggle room, and less premium.
*From reviews online, L3P touch controls are much more customizable than XM4s, so this should be something going for the L3Ps (just not the premium feel).

**Active Noise Cancelling**
*XM4 is a no-brainer. When activated, I'm feel very isolated from the noisy world. It cancels out low/mid/mid-high frequencies.
*L3P only really cancels out low frequencies. Anything above mid feels only dimmed passively.
*Not sure how they fare on airplanes / public transportations against engine noises (this is my main function for ANC).
*For XM4s, it takes 1~2 seconds for ANC to kick in (after it announces the mode) after mode-switching or putting into ear. Once it kicks in, the feel of difference is amazingly immense.
*L3Ps just kicks in instantly, but the feel of difference is very mild. Sometimes I feel no difference, and have to persuade myself there much be difference.

**Ear tips**
*XM4 uses foam ear tips, but for the demo unit in retail, the XM4 tips seem hardened and...kind of gross. Apparently these consume much faster. (nevertheless ANC works wonders)
*Could've played a role in the ANC performance. Not sure. But personally (ANC not considered), I prefer the traditional silicone ear tips.

**Charging Case**
*XM4's case feels slightly more premium than L3P's case, though both feel cheaper than, say, Sony's predecessor (XM3s).
*XM4 has the satisfying magnetic click upon shutting. But the L3P's sliding mechanism isn't bad either. Just not sure about the durability of both.

**Removing and placing earbuds from and into the charging case**
*XM4 feels very intuitive in positioning, while L3P is very awkward (you'll know if you try it yourself).
*Due to XM4's shape and material, it was kind of hard to take XM4's out of the magnetic case. The retailer had to help me once. But once taken out, it goes right into the ears very directly and intuitively.
*L3P's are not that easy to take out either, and I find myself having to resort to grabbing the ear-tips to take it out. And after taking it out, putting into ear takes some learning curve (again, awkward positioning).

**Transparency Mode**
*Didn't really care about this function, but tried anyways. Both feel similar.

headphones,"1 Week With The Austrian Audio HI-X65 &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pw2whqrq5va81.jpg?width=996&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b6968a746e6436ba0e60de84f64594e5c8f1e8

(This is my 1 week review of the Austrian Audio X65. Please note comparisons with the HD600 and X65 are with EQ. I will have a small section in the beginning without EQ on both, and the majority will be with EQ, as I tend to EQ everything, including the HD600. My EQ profile will be at the end for both the HD600 and X65)

Well it has been quite a week with the HI-X65 by Austrian Audio and I believe I'm ready to make a review on them. Please note I am not an experienced audiophile by any means, I am a simply guy who works out, listens to metal music, and plays games. I do not really like audiophile terms, nor do I believe that amps/dacs play a major role in overall sound quality. I believe all SS amps sound the same and dacs are over-blown in terms of audio perception, same with soundstage and all that in headphones.  So let's dive in with that all out of the way!

First: The unboxing:

Like I mentioned in my first impressions, it still stands. The unboxing is really friggin' good. More flashy than the HD600 but not extremely over-done. It's the perfect amount of premium. It's like adding salt to foods, too much or too little can ruin a meal, but the right amount leaves a fantastic impression. Comes with a long and short cable, the short I think is like 4ft and the long is closer to 10 feet. Both use a 2.5mm locking connector to 3.5mm termination, includes a quarter inch termination jack. Cable is nice in my opinion.

Comfort/Fit: Probably even more subjective than sound is the fit. I personally found out the box to be quite nice, but the leather took a toll on my head at first and the clamp wasn't extremely strong, still stable, but not overly-clampy like the HD600 (that I absolutely love). I did bend the metal headband on the X65 to make it clamp a bit more and it's good now. The leather also seems to have ""broken in"" and now it's fine, but still retains that leather feeling that I wish I could swap for a velour style. Austrian Audio told me in a DM on Instagram that they had no intentions on making velour pads so.... good luck! You can remove the pads and put either the Dekoni or Brainwavz velour over the pads, however, the L and R foam or filter under the pads is glued or adhered to the structure. Removing that probably voids the warranty so I'd advise against that.    

With the current band bent, I can head bang without issue, just not like the HD600.

Sound: 

\[Without EQ - HD600\] - Tonally nice, a bit ""thick"" sounding in the midrange with good extension in the treble. Not sibilant like the DT 1990 I owned or dark-sounding like the Ether 2 that I also used to own. If you're opposed to EQ and only want that good mid-range, the HD600 is still you're choice between these two. The bass rolls off and is noticeable on Korn's debut where they love to put that &lt;100 hz action into their music. It's been beat to death, but without EQ, it's in-offensive and not going to rub anyone the wrong way unless you really, really want that low end.

\[Without EQ - X65\] - More treble (still not sibilant in my opinion), more extension in the low end (really solid extension if you ask me) , and some slight wonk in the mid range. Around 1.6k and 3.5k on my unit. Without EQ, I do think it's solid still, but guitars sounding slightly distant and vocals lacking slightly.

\[With EQ - HD600\] I don't add much EQ, but I boost the low end and the air, as well as 400 hz. It thickens the low end (1) quite a bit and makes bass more prominent, but sounds stuffy and a bit intrusive. Not saying that negatively, rather just what it sounds like. It's my EQ so like I tuned it myself to my ears, I like how it sounds, even if the description used sounds negative. With EQ, it's basically as good as it gets (or so I thought!). Instruments are nicely separated and placed well. I don't have issues with imaging in gaming or anything, but the stage is ""small"". 

I really have nothing more to say on the HD600, it's a staple in the audiophile community for a reason. And it still should be.

\[With EQ - X65\] Oh boy, does this thing take EQ well. So, while it has good extension, with a decent boost does it move some air on that low end. Again, referencing Korn here, on the song ""Ball Tongue"" and ""Falling Away from Me"", the sub and impact is extremely well controlled (in my opinion) and doesn't bleed at all. On the song ""Hollow"" by Rivers of Nihil, the absolutely crazy double kick drum (or whatever it is, again, I just like music) is well defined and well controlled. The driver seems fast enough to keep up with the speed and I can notice and hear each strike. I found the HD600 slightly less in this area (not by much). ""Chocolate Chip Trip"" -TOOL has noticeably more impact (2) and is almost too much sometimes.  A final notice here is ""Scream"" by Avenged Sevenfold, they'd said sub is in here and  I did notice it on other headphones, but with EQ on the X65 (even without EQ to a certain point) it is prominent but not over-powering.

Mids on the X65 when eq'd are a joy. Upping those ranges listed above really makes guitars come alive and vocals ever more present. I think EQ'd, I like the mids here more than the HD600 (3). Everything just sounds ""right"". The song ""Third Eye"" by TOOL has a section 7:55-8:45 where a lack of 1-2k is noticeable, (Hifiman) and with EQ it nails that section. Guitars sound full, full of body and life. Piano strokes on ""Warmness on the Soul"" - Avenged Sevenfold are prominent and delivered well. Overall, I like the midrange.

Highs/Treble is more noticeable on the X65 vs the HD600 but I think that has more to do with the increased soundstage more than anything. They're not sibilant, but are more noticeable. Cymbals and higher frequencies again are noticed, but not overpowering or shimmeringly-sibilant. I'm quite sensitive to higher end frequencies (specifically 6-9k) and I have no issue on the X65. ""Fear Inoculum"" and ""Chocolate Chip Trip"" can irritate me on some headphones (DT1990) and they don't on here at all. If you like the highs on the HD600 but wish that they were more noticeable, yea, this'll do it. There is a peak I think \~6k but it doesn't bother me to much, but YMMV.

Soundstage, Detail and Imaging/Separation: These have incredible imaging and instrument separation. Again, ""Chocolate Chip Trip"" - TOOL (or basically all of Fear Inoculum) makes use of this to a T. Instruments are clearly defined in their own space and I have no issue discerning them at all. ""Exist"" by Avenged Sevenfold has tons of things happening at once and not once do I feel instruments blend together in a negative way as to lose track of them. Imaging in gaming is also solid, no issues playing Halo Infinite or anything else. Soundstage is wider than the HD600, but like I stated in my impressions, they're headphones. You're not going to get phenomenal soundstage, but it is wider and it is nicer to have more room. There is also more detail (4) in these than the HD600. In the song ""Revenga"" by SOAD, at 2:11 there's a feint clicking noise amidst Daron's monologue and I never noticed it on the track until this headphone showed up. Detail is great and I have no complaints here.

Vocal seperation here is also superb, if a song has multi or layered vocals, the X65 has no issue displaying them. It's really beautiful to listen to when it happens. Like ""Die Alone (In Your Lovers Arms) by Holding Absense is just bliss on this headphone. (and also the HD600, just less so).

Conclusion: These are great headphones, but do need EQ to fully shine, if you're okay with EQ these are your ""mid-fi"" cans to look for. I like these more than the HD600, 560s, DT 1990, Ether 2, etc. I'm kinda an Austrian Audio shill at this point and I'm fine with that. They nailed it with these headphones, and am excited to see where they go from here.

Footnotes: 

(1) - Not sure if it's distortion or just how it sounds on my rig. But the lows do seem thicker and ""bloated"".

(2) - More impact could be because the X65 seal better than the HD600 due to the leather pads, creating more isolation and therefore less ""air"". But the impact is better regardless

(3) - Personal preference, but the drivers seem slower on the HD600, creating a thicker sounding midrange vs the faster drivers on the X65. 

(4) - I really have no idea what detail is, but this is my interpretation of it: Hearing more of music that wasn't noticeable or present in other headphones or audio sources.

I am based in Europe, I ordered the Monarch MKII and was already excited to post my impressions here, but: It doesn´t fit, the left side is too large for me with any tip.

So I ask about sending them back, they say: No problem, just be aware that we will then charge a 35% ""restocking fee"". 350$!

So I check the consumer protection laws in Europe and, sure enough: this fee is illegal and they have to give me all the money back if they accept a return at all.

I tell them about this, they just reply: we are compliant with the law, if you don´t like these conditions, sell privately.

So I call our consumer protection agency and get this advice: Yeah, technically this fee is illegal, but if you don´t have insurance for this kind of thing, it will get expensive because China is hard to reach, and sometimes those companies don´t respond at all and there is not much I can do from here.

Hi, so I've been considering swapping out my DT990 pro 250 ohm headphones for the 32 ohm model of the DT990 premium, as it'd save me a lot of money not having to buy an amp (250 ohm ones are currently plugged directly into my computer, they sound good enough but I'm still considering purchasing an amp in the future.)

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, as long as the cables are balanced, and the headphone output source is also balanced, then a 2.5mm to 4.4mm balanced adapter should be okay to use right?

Which of the two should I go for? I'm leaning more towards the HD700 just cause of the traits it has over the Elegia (large soundstage and warmth) and he seems more keen of open backs now that he's given the Aeon Flow Closed a try and we talked extensively about the HD700 and he seems fond of it.

And a layer of high-pitched buzz that remains for \~30s after pausing. The volume of noise doesn't seem related to the set volume. And it happens no matter which device I connect them to.

headphones,"DT 770 Pro 32 Ohm review These are the first pair of ""high quality"" headphones I've owned and there is a lack of proper reviews of the 32 ohm variant of the DT770s. So with this I hope to capture my thoughts as well as give interested people an idea of what to expect from these.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p4c6oukj2oa81.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f20c82d469374197a32e83132b2724e0cc66c37

Before I delve into the actual review, let me lay down some details. I have used these for a little over 3 months now. Initially used them with a Samsung type-c to 3.5mm dongle. Recently I've gotten my hands on a Qudelix 5k and have switched over to using that exclusively. I listen to music mainly on Spotify (Instrumentals, Metal, rock and occasionally some pop) and my preference is towards a warmer sound signature, with the most value given to clarity and separation of instruments. 

Starting with the build quality, these feel incredibly solid. The padding on the headband and around the ear is quite comfortable. The 32 ohm variants do not have the velour pads the other impedance models have, and so i would expect a difference in sound quality as well. The clamping force is on the higher side, and this coupled with the faux leather pads make these exceptional at noise isolation. You'd be hard pressed to hear absolutely anything from outside with music playing at even a low volume. The downside to this is that these make your ears warm quite easily and you'll have a hard time wearing this for long periods, especially in warmer/humid regions. The height adjustment is quite tight and requires some effort to adjust. It has the feel of something that is meant to be done sparingly, rather than frequently. The upside is that they hold onto your preferred position and do not necessitate frequent adjustment.

Moving on to the sound quality, I would describe these as very crisp and detailed with a little extra emphasis on the low end. The highs are very clear and quite pleasant most of the time. Though there is also some harshness at certain frequencies, which can lead to some hiss when certain instruments are playing. The instrument separation sounds really good to my ears, you will be able to pick out and focus on individual instruments even when the music gets chaotic. The bass is also really good and doesnt muddy the rest of the music. Its a tight focused sort of feel that you don't get with most mainstream wireless headphones. These sound a lot better once you've had the chance to EQ them. You'll be able to get rid of the harshness in the highs quite easily. These are quite capable and extremely pleasing to listen to once you've sorted out and tuned them to your liking. They especially shine with Metal and rock.

There isn't particularly much soundstage in my opinion. By virtue of the isolation alone you sort of lose a sense of depth. One other point that I would like to mention is that I found it really hard to get these loud. The low impedence suggensts that they should be well suited to mobile use, but thats not the case from my usage. From my phone, and when using the 3.5mm dongle, I was only able to get these as loud enough as ""I"" needed. The problem is I listen at a much lower volume than most people. When my brother wanted to try these, they wouldnt go as loud as he wanted. From a macbook pro 3.5mm port these can get much louder than out of a mobile jack, which leads me to believe that these do need some amount of amplification. The Qudelix 5k can get these extremely loud, so if you have something like that you should be fine.

In conclusion, I think these are extremely good sounding headphones for a newbie like me, they really do blow most mainstream/popular headphones like the xm4 out of the water easily. Owing to their build quality I should be able to use them for quite a while too.

I will be using them in my room (quiet conditions), plugged in my pc and sometimes in my phone. I am looking for a pair that still provides decent sound without an amplifier. 

I look for (from personally the most to least important): 

-sound quality and richness
-comfort
-good bass abilities 

Choosing between:

-Sennheiser HD599
-Sennheiser HD58x
-Beyerdynamic DT 990 pro or DT 770 pro


I would appreciate if you would help me choose between those or give me some other similar options. I'd love to hear some quality but not mainstream headphones that could offer a lot for a cheaper price.

headphones,"Should Spotify add lossless music? When browsing this subreddit, I came across [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/ryyxcz/spotify_finally_comments_on_status_of_spotify_hifi/) talking about a recent update regarding lossless audio on Spotify. As someone who's always used Spotify, I was interested. I had heard some people talk about not being able to hear the difference, so I decided to test my hearing skills by taking an [ABX test](http://abx.digitalfeed.net/). Going into this, I was quite confident in my hearing. People have often praised me for pointing out sounds others couldn't hear (e.g. a high pitched noise in old tv's or in alarms). Suffice to say I was disappointed when I couldn't hear a single difference whilst taking the test—the results reflected this. Surprised, and curious about whether this was normal, I made a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/rz49p0/can_you_hear_the_difference_between_lossless_and/) about it. 

# What is lossless anyway?

For the uninitiated, steaming services compress original music files, so that they take up less space. When doing so, however, some detail is lost. This type of music is called ""lossy"", and it's what Spotify currently uses. (Keep in mind that from here on I'll be referring to the highest quality available, being 320 kbps)  
Lossless music, however, isn't uncompressed, but rather compressed through a certain algorithm, which makes sure little to no detail is lost. Music processed in this way is called ""lossless"", and its quality is around 1,411 kbps.

# Results of the aforementioned poll

At the time of writing this, 228 people said that they *could* hear the difference, whilst 280 people said they *couldn't*. In the comments, many people pointed out that they could only hear the difference on songs they know really well, after a lot of A/B'ing in a quiet room, with their high-quality gear. Some people pointed out that they play an instrument, and that, if they focus really hard on said instrument, they'd be able to tell the difference. Moreover, most people agreed that the genre and recording quality played a huge role in their results. 

# Should Spotify add lossless music?

I would like to preface this part by mentioning that the following is my own opinion, based on the information I gathered. Feel free to share your opinion in the comments.  
Given that most Spotify users are listening through their cheap earbuds, whilst being on the go, and that even people with super high-end gear can barely hear the difference, I don't think there's much to gain by adding lossless music; it'll most likely make a minimal impact on their audience. Hence I conclude that Spotify most likely *won't* add lossless music, but, so as to give the devil his due, I've compiled some counterarguments.   
Seen as most other streaming services have adapted, some users might think Spotify is falling behind, and choose another platform. It thus wouldn't surprise me if they would add lossless just for the sake of keeping up with the competition. Furthermore, it might create a placebo effect on uniformed uses—which is most of their audience—leading them to believe that they're getting a huge increase in quality, even though they can't hear a difference. 

# Closing thoughts

Whatever Spotify decides to do, I'll keep on using it, as I can't tell any difference. I like Spotify for its intuitive interface, the great algorithm and my long history with it. If you're deciding on which platform to use, consider taking the test I linked earlier to see if lossless audio is really something you need. I'll be damned if I don't mention that Spotify pays their artists considerably less than their rivals, like Tidal and Apple Music, as can be seen in the picture below. This is also worth keeping in mind when making your decision  
Let me know what you think about this topic!

headphones,"Comparison write up: Hifiman Ananda vs Monoprice M1570 Closed I have the ananda and recently picked up the m1570 closed. I think I’m preferring the1570 closed overall. Here’s a quick comparison for those that might be interested in the ~$500 planar market.  

BASS: they have similar quality and extension but the ananda is a little better. It has better impact and takes more EQ before distortion, but the m1570 will surely satisfy just about everyone, especially if you use an amp with bass boost (eg ifi xbass), Loki, or use EQ. Without EQ they’re pretty much equal. 

MIDS: this came as a surprise to me but I prefer the mids on the m1570. After A/Bing the two, I can now see how the ananda is described by some as being “thin”. The m1570 is smoother, denser, and more musical, but overall they’re fairly close. 

TREBLE: the ananda has a lot more air and such, but it’s open so it’s not a fair comparison. They’re both really neutral and have great extension I think. The m1570 is really good here, it’s not lacking for detail and has plenty of sparkle. Neither are overly bright or dark, perfect for my tastes. 

IMAGING: the ananda has better separation, but the frequency distribution feels more random. The m1570 seems more cohesive all around. Image size and clarity are definitely better on the ananda. I’m always impressed by the image size the big egg planars present, and how easy it is to pick details out if the mix. It’s just that they’re sorta seeming to come from weird places at times, where the m1570 has everything placed as expected. 

SOUNDSTAGE: the ananda is taller, forward/rear depth is about the same, and the m1570 is actually wider. This makes the m1570 feel more 3d, and for lack of a better word, makes the ananda literally seem more “planar”. The lack of width in the ananda does make it feel more intimate and intense, especially with the larger images and great separation. But I find that I like the m1570 is better for gaming and cinema, and some genres of music. I love the ananda for psytrance since the sounds are are digital anyways, and it’s great to have them coming from all over the place in a really intense way. But the soundstage of the m1570 just seems more “natural” for soundtracks and analog music. 

DETAIL: both are about the same. As alluded to ananda is better but not by much. The details are easier to find on the ananda, but they’re all still there when you go looking in the 1570. 

OVERALL: the m1570 is great for the price. It’s my new daily driver. Better build quality than the ananda, though much heavier. I don’t mid the weight and think they’re fairly equal in terms of comfort. I still really enjoy the ananda, but closed back is a requirement for most of my listening at home and listening and I don’t feel like I’m missing out at all with the m1570. It’s also gotten much better with time too so I now believe in burn-in.

headphones,"Found a Good DIY Solution to a Worn Out Headband Cushion After years of use the headband pad and earpads on my ath-msr7's were falling apart, the leather was slowly coming off in little flakes that would get on my ears and clothes. They still sound great so I wanted to get them replaced. New earpads are available online so I just got new ones, but the only thing I could find to buy online for the headpad was a tacky and bulky sleeve with a zipper to go over it. So I decided to mod it and I think it turned out much better than a sleeve would have.

&amp;#x200B;

[What ATH-msr7's look like new](https://preview.redd.it/viq1dndufka81.png?width=396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdb7256431892e724c7cf9a59eda45d59c7c813d)

First I cut off the cloth and leather covering the headband (it looked like the earpads do in the pic below), leaving the foam, wiring, etc. underneath in place.

&amp;#x200B;

[1. Leather and Cloth Cut Off](https://preview.redd.it/vqrffce2gka81.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78aa4c4639ff52d24a3c4fbaa1a217880d2bceab)

Second, since the headband was previously sealed with the leather/cloth covering I wanted to try and waterproof it a bit now that its removed. I wrapped headband in clingwrap and taped up the ends with scotch tape.

&amp;#x200B;

[2. Wrap headband in clingwrap and tape up the ends to protect the interior from water](https://preview.redd.it/q3o1tnepgka81.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35601ab11be079c03f44753bfec0a2ec8df37566)

Third, I took an old worn-out t-shirt, washed it, and cut a long piece of cloth from it (just going around the circumference of the shirt was long enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I wrapped the cloth around the headband tightly and just looping the end back into itself is secure enough to keep it on.

After ordering new earpads, here is the finished product:

headphones,"How much sound quality does wireless actually lose? Hi,

So I have some Chinese earbuds (Artiste DC1), that I am pretty happy with.

I have been considering getting some wireless buds for the convenience, and possibly with noise cancelling too for flying.

However, I keep reading that I’ll really notice a drop in sound quality, even if I spend a lot more.  Is this *actually* true, or just people scaremongering to justify their purchases?

Am I really to believe that going from some wired $25 earbuds to some Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus or Panasonic RZ-S500W at 4x the price, or even Sony WF-1000XM4 at 10x, wouldn’t come with a big step up in sound quality, or at least not be a step down?

I know price isn’t the only indicator of quality, and I’m not trying to start an argument, but given I can’t try earbuds before I buy I want to try to understand how much difference wireless *really* makes.

Vorbis = Very, Very bad handling of white noise sounds if the bitrate is 96 ~ 275kbps it just turns it into weird mess

headphones,"Stereo image narrower/wider depending on playback device? **Hey everyone, hope you're doing well!**

**Sennheiser HD600** listener here. Been observing a phenomon that has never been as clear and contrastful to me as now:

So far I've used an **M-Audio/Avid C400 USB audio interface** for listening and producing music on my computer systems. Sometimes I'd take my **Motorola Moto G4 smartphone** for couch moments.

When it comes to frequency response, loudness and soundstage I could never really complain about anything using these devices. For sure there are far better option to drive the HD600, but the experience has always felt neutral and very good for analyzing and enjoying mixes.

However, after christmas I decided to treat myself with a **new Audient ID14 MKII USB audio interface**

The moment I listened to my favorite music with it, I realized that through this new interface: 

1) the **stereo image** felt much **narrower than before**. 
2) On the other side, everything seemed **more clear** and **distinguishable**. Instrument positions/areas in the stereo field as well as frequencies were much **easier to pinpoint** than with the other devices.

Now I've been wondering what could be the cause of such a difference. I am yet not sure if I find the narrower soundstage to be better or worse.

Could it be related to stereo crosstalk or impedances?

Do you guys have any other clue?

headphones,"The price of things in Canada is disgusting. This is just a quit rant, I apologize if this shit is frowned upon here, but whatever. I just went on Amazon to buy a pair of KPH30i and Grado pads. The total came to 40 dollars. No problem! Sounds like a good deal to me! Then, as I'm checking out I realized Koss sent me to the U.S Amazon site. No problem, I head over to amazon.ca and see that the KPH30i are $60-66 instead of $29. I couldn't believe it so I browsed Amazon a bit more. No luck. Tried to find other websites that ship to Canada or are Canadian based. No luck. Finally, I say fuck it, let's see how much the pads cost with the headphones. $86 COMPARED TO $40.98 IN THE US. THIS IS BEFORE SHIPPING AND HANDLING. I understand that the dollar is different, but only by about 20 cents. I also understand that over the past 2 years, things have become pricier due to the pandemic, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Our groceries are insanely expensive, rent is impossible, and our minimum wage stays the same. This post will likely get taken down, but whatever. This is completely unfair. I'm supposed to pay nearly twice the price for cheap headphones simply because I live in Canada. And I know, I have it a lot better than the majority of people on Earth, there are probably billions of people who would die to be in my situation, but I still have the right to complain.

headphones,"Searching for headset, headphone for big head Hello everybody. 

I am searching for a Gaming Headset in the category ""big head"" and ""correction glasses"" friendly.

My head size is between 60-62 cm. I always have problems with headphones because the pressure on my head is to much. 

I like good audio quality so I bought a AKG Pro 275. It is definitely a game-changer. But, and this is a big but, the pressure on long time session ist just too much. It begins to hurt after a while.

Luckily, I was able to test the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 and the Steelseries Artic 9. 

First to the Beyerdynamic MMX 300. Despite that I always see reviews that are bragging about the build quality, I really have to say that I do not think they are exceptional. Especially in their price category. I have to say I was a little bit disappointed. On the other hand. The velour ear coffins are really nice. But overall the MMX 300 is on the more ""pressure"" side if I can say so. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being a lot of pressure and 1 being no pressure, they are a 6 to 7.

Then I was able to test the Steelseries Arctic 9. I am sure that the sound quality is less pleasurable I found them really nice to wear.  They had a ""loose fit"" style and, as far as I can say, on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being a lot of pressure and 1 being no pressure, they are a 2 or a 3. 

Sadly I do not like wireless and USB headphones. I had Sennheiser wireless headphones and they had a slight but noticeable irritable noise. I think native English speakers, would refer to ""background noise"" (german= Grundrauschen; swiss german=grundruuuschä .-)) 

So my categories are:   
\- Big head 

\- glasses friendly

\- wired (no USB, no wireless)

\- detachable micro (or just headphones and not headsets)

Do you have any other headphones, headset suggestions?

I really appreciate your help.

headphones,"Bluetooth headphone without the digital beeps or buzzes? I am on the lookout for a bluetooth headphone that doesn't have that obvious digital buzzing connection sound while it's connected. I have used the Philips shb3075 for years now but they seem to be less and less available so after mine died, I tried and bought a few different ones but they all seem to have that beeping and buzzing in the background while connected.

I went to a store where they sold a massive range of headphones but the guy had no idea what I meant with the digital background sound. He then went on a weird rant about older people (im in my 40's) always want to buy cheap headphones but expect high quality for a dime. Slightly weirded out by this passive aggressive remark, he adviced me a headphone that costed more than I was initially intended to spend but I was desperate for a good working headphone.

I returned it because surprise, surprise it had major bleeping and buzzing going on. My husband has trouble hearing that sound, but my daughter hears it as well. So I suspect my hearing is just in a bit higher range. (I read that woman can be more susceptible to hearing higher frequencies).

Wired isn't an option, sadly. I tried several different brands of headphones but they all makes that sound in the background. I am hoping that there is anyone here who picks up what my problem is and if there are any headphones out there that I'm able to listen to without those digital sounds in the background. Surely if the philips shb3075 (which used to be a cheap entry model even) was able to do it, there must be others?

Budget isn't much of an issue, but I wear it a lot while laying down as well, so it would be preferred if it isn't a very bulky one.

I also tried several of those expensive wireless in-ear phones, but I have quite a small posture and a tiny head so those in-ears are always way to big for me and I can't get them seated in my ear in a good way and also the battery charge of those is a tad short.

headphones,"Beating a dead horse. What are the worst stock headphone cables and why is the answer Hifiman? I have owned 40 +/- headphones (counting IEMs and ear buds). Most of them have been good, some of them amazing. Ever since owning models with a removable cable I have refused to buy any headphones without a removeable cable. So we are not talking about headphone cables that are not removeable, they are all disqualified. Also connector type is not really what this is about either. Some people love the HD800 connectors (who are these people?) and some hate them. Too many personal preferences here. 

 As for the included cables, I only tend to notice the cables if the are particularly bad or very good. I don't know how many people will agree on my favorite choice but I think most will be ready to 'beat a dead horse' when it comes to my nominees for worst stock cable. To be clear, I am not talking about sound. I do believe cables can have  A VERY SMALL IMPACT on sound, but that subject is also for another day. I am talking about functionality, build quality, feel, durability and aesthetics. 

The best **stock** cable I have ever used or touched is the new LCD-XC single ended cable (they also offer it balanced). It checks all of the boxes for me. Feels and looks durable. It has a nice simple color (all black). It never tangles or coils itself and has zero microphonics. 

I have three nominees. My first nominee is not too bad on first glance, but as we all know, looks are often deceiving. The E-MU Teak cables look very nice and the connectors are decent, but they are super fragile and microphonic. I have had to repair the solder on both 2.5mm ear cup connectors and the 3.5mm amplifier end as well. I now use Hart audio cables for these instead. Problem Solved. 

Nominee number one above used to be the only cable that I bitched about. Enter nominee number two, Hifiman 'medical tubing' cable. I had read about the cables, I had seen photos. I was still unprepared for how bad the Hifiman 'Medical tube' cables could actually be. When I opened the box I literally mumbled ""holy fuck"". The tubing actually looks like USED medical tubing. BONUS it also  feels like used medical tubing. It also has the cheapest looking connectors I have ever seen and the 3.5mm one is angled, WTF?  To the credit of this cable it has zero microphonics and coil memory. 

Nominee number three enters the room to a chorus of boos. The deceptively, not bad looking or feeling, Hifiman Arya cloth cable. This cable would be really decent if: 1- it came with $99 headphones, not $1600 headphones. 2- It did not have the memory of an Elephant and the microphonics of......well...a  lapel mic. This effing cable will literally stand up in a vertical coil on my desk and stay like that, for many hours. It is constantly twisting up and entering your line of site for no reason. It can never just hang out of the way. (Hart Audio Cables to the rescue again). I always forget about the annoying microphone capability of this cable because the memory issue is so dominant, but even without the memory issue, the micrphonics are a deal breaker here. To be fair- the cloth covering is not bad and it does feel extremely durable (like a Tonka Toy).

headphones,"ZMF Aeolus old vs new driver mesh seems to make a big difference! I was trying to diagnose a weird crinkling I was hearing on my secondhand Aeolus. ZMF support helped me fix it by taking off the pads and smoothing out the mesh that sits between the driver and pad, and informed me that they had changed the type of mesh used since my unit's date of manufacture (so only about a year ago).

I went to their site and bought the [new mesh](https://shop.zmfheadphones.com/collections/diy/products/acoustic-titan-mesh), and I just received and installed it today. Now, take this all with a grain of salt as I did absolutely 0 scientific testing and am far too lazy to swap the mesh back and forth to compare directly, but I swear my Aeolus sound better and clearer than before?

It would make a decent amount of sense too, as physically the old mesh was quite a bit denser and thicker than the new kind. So perhaps too much dampening was happening and muddying the sound?

Anyways, yeah I don't know if anyone has done more thorough/scientific testing on this, but I'd be interested to see how the different meshes compare in some measurements for sure.

headphones,"My experience producing music with the BeyerDynamic DT-1990 Pro Over the last few years, I've recreationally produced music, and will soon be releasing my first solo EP. Before I started producing, I used my Beyer's for everything - gaming, listening, general use - and always loved them. They sound fantastic, and have amazing detail, clarity, and airiness. However, my experience using them for producing has been less positive. 

I would make compositions that sounded great on these headphones, but when I listened to the mix on any of my other audio sources (M50x, car speakers, airpods, etc) it would sound muddy and oftentimes straight up bad. All of the subtle details and separation that was obvious on the DT 1990s would be totally lost on pretty much all other sources. After noticing this pattern, I made a few little beats while using my M50x's and the results were MUCH better. My mixes popped even more when I listened to them on the Beyers. What I learned was that if I could hear details on the M50x's, then they would be crystal clear and stand out on the Beyers (in a good way), and also sound good on other less-than-ideal sound systems.

headphones,"QCY HT03. Tremendous Value at Low Budget! **TLDR:** 
They are AirPods Pro-styled TWS earbuds with actually working ANC for about US$35. Basic sound quality with a neutral target.  Has a companion app (optional) &amp; both left+right bud can be used independently. No Multipoint, no wireless charging. Extremely good value for its asking price

**Basic Detail:**
QCY &amp; similar brands have been making TWS earbuds for quite a while now. At this point, it's disingenuous to call such products mere cheap clones or copies of the mainstream versions *(Apple AirPods/Sony WF-XMs/Jabra Elites/Samsung Galaxy Buds)* though those still exists.Rather, these days such products are catering to a price point not captured by the bigger brands. 

At this point in-time for the TWS market, ANC is increasingly becoming a baseline feature and QCY, with the HT03, has an insanely affordable model with said functionality for under US$50.

**Build Quality:**
It's plastic, it's glossy, it's basic. Feels like a cheap plastic toy in the hand. The upside is that they are extremely lightweight, feels even lighter than the OG AirPods in the ears.

The case is also made of a similar plastic quality. Looks, feels and operates cheaply. The lids will slam shut with gravity alone, no extra hinge mechanism to hold it further open. The magnets to pull in the buds are also passingly weak.

**App and Controls:**
The app is laughably bad with English localisation and seems to ask way too much permissions like Location for pairing and disabled battery optimization and an account login. The app will however still run even ignoring the permission requests and account creation though pairing for customization with the app might be more difficult.

However, the app makes it up more than it takes from the user by allowing individual customization for single, double &amp; triple taps for both earbuds. This is something the bigger brands don't even have as a standard feature. You also can just configure the controls once &amp; delete the app, the buds will save the configuration.

The touch controls are pretty lackluster though. It works, but there is no audio feedback for your taps, so no idea if your buds registered a single, double or triple tap; you just have to wait for the results to find out.

The short stem also means it's basically impossible to hold the buds without activating something. It's probably why by default, single-tap does nothing.

**Fit &amp; Sound Quality**
These buds have oval-style tips mimicking the AirPods Pro, but removing the tips reveal a standard nozzle instead of the AirPods Pro 'mini-speaker' type.

They accepted my standard Spinfit 1025s fine, though you might need to coax the eartips over the nozzle slightly harder than with other earbud models.

With my Spinfits + its extremely lightweight, they wear absolutely comfortably in my ear with a good-enough seal for some passive noise cancelling.

The sound quality is what you should expect for a US$40 pair. It won't provide the fullest soundstage, but it also doesn't overwhelmingly target a 'V-shaped' frequency response. The audio is actually quite balanced if not a bit muddy by default; this can be surprisingly alleviated alot by using Wavelet's AutoEQ, using the AirPods Pro as the target correction.

**ANC:**
Here's the real pudding. This actually works. It's not Sony levels of ANC, but it does tune out a lot of the more obvious ambient noise such as a ticking clock, appliance humming and the harsher pitches of a metro's rumbling; ANC isn't magic, it's not gonna silence a jackhammer or an low overhead aircraft. 

The HT03 ANC algorithm also appears to have a few seconds lag as it takes about that long for the effects to start after switching it on. So rapid changes in ambient sound isn't handled too well, but the attenuation effects are there

More surprisingly, its transparency/passthrough mode is about 70% as effective as Apple's version; it can sound metallic, but again it actually works &amp; it isn't just a suggestion of passthrough audio.

In all, you can be looking at 65 - 70% ANC of what you'd get from a more expensive pair for a way cheaper price.

**Ending comments:**
The HT03s are made to a price point, but QCY actually put the cost to where it actually matters the most, namely the ANC.

The whole physical product looks and feels cheap, but it didn't trade away size or weight nor did it offensively gimp the sound quality to pretend it delivers a fuller soundstage

It's not gonna beat out a proper pricey pair of ANC earbuds, but for about US$50 and you can find it for even less quite often, it's really gives tremendous value for what you're paying for.

I used to be big into headphones, even got a pair of HD800 (not S), before I realized speakers were more fun. I'm going to write these reviews in a likely offensive manner, mostly because I've been to What Hi-Fi and I cringe at everything ever written on that website.

  
Amplification was through my Macbook Pro 13. I played the same songs through Plex, most of which are FLAC, but let's be honest I'm not mastering any Grammy nominations here. My amplification level is out of 16. I don't listen to things loudly. Songs were:  


*(Interlude 1)* \- Alt-J: basically a cappella, just a test to see if it makes the weird harmonics in this song any weirder  


*Deadly Valentine* \- Charlotte Gainsbourg: a tough song since the mix is a bit congested in general, but sounds epic  


*Motherboard* \- Daft Punk: probably the best mixed song of the bunch. It tells you about the headphones, and you're way cooler for not using Get Lucky, even though you know it way better. Great test for imaging.  


*House of Glass* \- Holy Fuck: Listen to this song, it's excellent for testing transients and bass-to-mid frequencies, and also for getting off your tits.  


*Just the Same but Brand New* \- St. Vincent: Slightly recessed vocals, not the best mix for testing, but I know the song, and it's goes from quiet to loud.  


*Port of Call* \- Beirut: Know this song well, great acoustics, test for separation, and showing my general support for Zach Condon.  


It's a mix of songs that are well mastered, have different mixing strategies (a cappella vs orchestral, acoustic vs. electronic), and also songs I know well. I might add one or two more songs if I do this again, but right now, I know these songs well and cover a good spectrum. It's how I establish credibility before undermining that in basically a long meme.

**Sony ANC from 2005 (stock pads)**

Initial comments: These were the first pair of headphones I ever bought. I bought them at a college supply store for a summer camp in 2005, just after my sophomore year of high school. The ear pads were flaking like black dandruff so I swapped them for new ones, not OEM but close enough. They’re on ear with no ‘cupping’ (like Beats Solo 3, for example). So they’re going to be GOOD.

Comfort is bad, on ear, feel plastic hitting the ear. Also the headband is plastic and touches your head, but the ear pain doesn’t make you notice. Pre-Beats era though!

Amplification: 8/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Muffled, distortion on word ‘thoughts’, overall not terrible for a piece of shit.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Weird clicking during the first chorus, narrow soundstage. Fortunately the song is better than the headphones.

String instruments sound recessed, almost like vocals are bussed to the same reverb. Whatever it is Sebastiàn’s mixing is all for naught. Or nought. Whatever.

Oh forgot, the bass is there, but imprecise.

I’m hearing a synthesizer I haven’t heard on the right channel in the last chorus. Or is that distortion?

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

The imaging test! It fails.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Absolutely no separation, sounds like a compressor added. The transient test also fails. I have to mention at this point that some of the detail retrieval above the 1khz-ish region is surprising. I’m assuming it’s bringing some things forward that shouldn’t be there, but still an interesting listen.

Treble around 1:40ish mark sounds artificially boosted, without sounding piercing.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Where are the mids. These headphones probably wouldn't handle a cappella at all, if you like listening to bad music

*Port of Call - Beirut*

Surprisingly handles this one well. It seems like voices + high or low instruments are fine, but only one of the three or all three becomes too much. 

It’s that time of the month, time to swap pads

**Sony ANC from 2005 (max pads)**

Conversion: used some fancy BrainWavz pads from amazon intense for over ear. They’re perforated. For whatever reason, there were also additional foam rings to put on the outside of the foam covering the driver. So it was like filling a donut with a donut hole, so to speak. I mainly did this because the max pads were a little loose feeling, and I figured it would put some space between my ears and the foam glued to the driver grill. Comfort on the ears is way higher, but now the headband (which has no padding and is just plastic) is more noticeable.

Amplification: 12/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Lol this sounds worse? Voices are a little nasally now. Imaging doesn’t seem any better. Then again, this is my Glee track for people that like music.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Bass initially seems better, deeper, and separated from mids. There isn’t much extension, but compared to ‘full mixes’ in the last test this could be worse. Piano jam in between verse and chorus sounds weird, almost like it’s undergoing a slow phaser. Chorus just hit, soundstage is much better. Who knew putting distance between your ears and the driver was good. Besides people that make on-ear headphones.

Going back to the start, the filtered-swept oscillator in the verse is really present. I’m guessing there’s a treble spike somewhere around 8kHz.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

The water drop percussive sound is really weird. At least it’s separate from the rest of the mix. Have the say the bass is acceptable now, I’d say ‘accurate’ in terms of amount and separation for a closed back headphone. For something I refuse to trash it’s doing well.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Lol treble is pretty bad. Bass is a lot more fun. It still fails the transient test, but I’m having while it does.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Sometimes I feel like these headphones have an auto-karaoke effect where the vocals disappear. Maybe it’s got built-in Izotope frequency editor. Drum break sounds good.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Again transients aren’t brilliant, but it could be worse. During main arpeggio (goes throughout the song) there’s a honkiness that’s somehow not part of the actually brass instruments. 

Considering these headphones came out when N\*Sync were still popular, I think they’re good enough for bad music.

**Phillips Running Headphones**

Comfort: I can feel the seam where the silicon was pressed scraping my right ear. 

Amplification: 4/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Lol these aren’t terrible. It’s a bit echoey, which I think is a result of the tip design. They’re earbuds, not IEMs. Still, I’ve heard worse.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

The low-pass filtered beginning sounds… more filtered.

Oddly high amount of separation, but I think it’s really just the wonky frequency response creating artificial divisions. Or maybe it’s really not that bad? 

On further review, penalty stands: mids are muffled, and not because there’s too much bass. Or maybe there is, and it’s just not reaching my ear. The pianos are so present it’s actually a nice listen, unless you like anything else in your music.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Surprisingly competent. Remember some of these songs are better mixed than others, so they’ll sound great (as far as being a song goes, not revealing the flaws of your source) regardless of how you listen to them.

Treble is also recessed in a strange way… percussive sounds in the higher frequencies are muted. Better than shrill. Or maybe I’m better off just not listening to music.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Lol the mids are so congested. I feel like there’s a 3 band EQ, and it artificially boosts something in the low end, the mid range, and the high end. Everything in between is lost.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

The guitar picking sounds nice. I’m sure she used these running buds when recording.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

It sounds like he took a few sniffs of helium, wtf is this upper mid range treble. 

*Overall*: I would say they’re fining for running, but the fit is poor and the silicone rubber tips are better used for cleaning deadskin off your feet.

**Turkish Airlines Earbuds**

Comfort: Not bad, they fit quite snugly. Cables are super cheap and thin, I’m pretty sure they’re 1 strand of conducive material. If you care about blue earbuds and only care about the color and nothing else, these might be for you.

Amplification: 5

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Are these earbuds or metal cans with string in between. There’s a weird resonance after the echo… and it’s quite shrill the second I turn the volume up since I can’t hear much.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

No bass, no mids, no highs. I can basically make out the snare. Instrument separation is the best I’ve ever heard, namely because it sounds like the instruments were separated from the track and I’m listening to the wet signal of the reverb at end of signal chain.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

These headphones are a great way to simulate being underwater while listening to music you care about.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Weirdly the bass is still there are the beginning, and the hi hats/drums overall somehow make it through. I was going to say it’s the least affected song, but there are quiet parts that resonate and pierce my eardrums.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

At this point these headphones are only good at providing a stereo image, in that you hear the shit version of what you were trying to listen to in each ear separately.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Git Gud Turkish Airlines

*Overall:* Pretty bad, I’d rather quit listening to recordings of anything than use these again. I think I could turn them into an interested effect pedal by sending signal in, recording output. 

**1More Triple Driver**

Have had these for about 5 years, should replace the tips but decided to buy new headphones instead. ’Tis the /r/headphones way.

No removable plug is a screw, but at least there’s a built-in mic. This is basically an upgrade to Apple Earbuds pre-AirPods.

Amplification: 4/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Listening to this after the Turkish Airlines Air Pods, it sounded good enough. Mid sounded somewhat relaxed.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

I forgot how good this song was after the Turkish Airlines incident. Now that I’m acclimated to hearing music again, everything sounds very good, but I can tell there are some details missing. 

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Instrument separation isn’t great, but it’s a superb recording. Now noticing the lack of subs around the 3:13ish mark.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Good texture to the bass. Also transients are nice.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Treble seems accurate, bass is rich (not a ton of low end extension in this song), but mids are recessed. Better headphones for rock/electronic/high action music.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Oddly seems better than St. Vincent in terms of hearing vocals. The song makes up for inadequacies in the headphones.

Depending on your weeb level the lack of waifus may be off-putting. These might as well have been Sennheiser Orpheus compared to Turkish Airlines. I know people say V-shaped and whatever, but it’s not surprising to see why people still recommend them. Plus, there are no anime titties, so you can wear them at work or in public.

**Drop/JVC HD-FXA1 Dual Carbon**

Build quality is great, packaging is great, the leather case peels super easily (I haven’t taken them anywhere and they’re showing wear). Comfort is good initially, but they are seemingly heavy.

Amplification: 4/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Only thing missing seems to be spaciousness of regular headphones. All the weirdness of the duo vocals is totally there.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Great bass extension, great separation, only thing missing is basically soundstage. Kickdrum is so good in this, especially when you really get a good seal.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Transients are excellent, texture in the treble is the best I’ve heard so far. Kick drum has tons of impact and a tiny bit of boominess.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Really good test of how good these are at detail. Low end is super nice. Treble starting to pierce a little bit.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Vocals sound a little recessed, but that’s because there isn’t much separation between that and the other instruments. I should mention by now the vocals in this track are recorded to be a little in the background, not front and center throughout.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Not much to comment on. The outro can easily get congested here and doesn’t.

These sound amazing, but that weight is killer. I can’t imagine you get much better than this regardless of how much more you spend.

**Etymotic XRSR4 extra bass etc**

Comfort and Build: I think this is where I start to make sex jokes. The best tips (though they’re so long you’d argue it’s not ‘just the tip’) are the anal bead ones, with three sets of ‘ribs’ to close up the leakage. Jesus Christ I’m about to pass out from the possible jokes. In any case, it is weird for maybe an hour or two, but you get used to it. The thing you’re always conscious of after the fact is the feeling that your head is pressurized. They are super lightweight, and I bought them to compete with the JVC’s. If not for weight, I think JVC would win, but these are still excellent.

Packaging is good, cable has some slight microphonic above Y split. 

Amplification: 5/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Seems accurate, and good detail retrieval. I can hear the reverb well on these.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Things sound a little congested with the bass synth in the chorus. Again, detail retrieval is excellent. Imaging is solid considering there’s a lot going on this song. Bass is present and seems good, but doesn’t get you hyped. 

Note: that synth in the right channel I mentioned during the Sony ANC stock ‘review’ is back! Sounds like it’s bitcrushed square wave with a HPF. These earbuds are so good it validates shitty ones!

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Imaging is a lot better, but also the mix is different than Deadly Valentine. Everything sounds really effortless. You can tell the bass rolls off a bit, but it’s all pleasant. 

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Lots of energy, lots of detail, great transients. The more subtle elements of a very sound song become apparent. I haven’t heard this song since I got these headphones, I’m hyped like the first time I heard the record.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

The narrow soundstage doesn’t do the mids any favors, but the details are excellent.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Great instrument separation in this one, you can really hear the dynamics of the strings being strummed. The slightly recessed mids make the build up toward the end less impactful. Nitpicking, just because it looks like I’m gushing over my Etyrotics. 

Overall: I keep talking about how detailed these are, and now I want to try them against the JVC’s again. Or not. These are awesome earbuds with tips for all your kinks.

**V-Moda Crossfade Wireless fancy apt-x version**

I’ve had these for about 4 years and used them tons. V-shaped response, overall quite comfortable. I installed the XL pads a while back.

Amplification Notes: set at 5 on wired, set at 7 on wireless. I’ve always thought the bluetooth amplification was better than whatever built-in one I’ve had, such as phones, laptops, etc. It almost sounds like there’s more detail with the Bluetooth, but it’s very slight and hard to AB.

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

You can tell it’s a bit recessed, especially after the Etymotics. Still, it sounds nice and I don’t hear any obvious dips. Also, it’s nice to wear over-ears again.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Treble on percussion seems recessed, it’s a very dark sound; mids are recessed but it’s not V-shaped. It’s also not the same as Beats where you straight up don’t hear anything outside bass, which seems tight.

I used to own the M-100s (wired), and when I compared them, the M-100 seemed to have more bass impact. That’s why these ‘feel’ a bit more natural.

The magical hidden synth is there, but I have to concentrate a bit more.

It’s weird, the mids and treble aren’t that present but the soundstage and imaging are way more believable. That’s over-ears vs. IEMs for you.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Everything sounds natural, even on bass heavy headphones like this everything makes it through the mix. Seriously, if you’re on the fence about a pair of headphones but want to keep them, listen to this song.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Sometimes this song seems like it was made for these headphones. Tons of fun, not as detailed as the Etymotics, but even more hyped.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Vocals are surprisingly solid for an acoustic song. The other mid-centric instruments do get a bit lost.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

I think What Hi Fi would say ‘good energy’ in the pros and ‘flatulence in the temporal arrhythmia’ in the cons column. 

Overall: It’s v-shaped, it’s v-named, it’s bluetooth, it’s built like a tank. You can get custom Waifu prints on the side to match your Moondrops. It’s not really a reference pair of headphones, but if you like music you’ll like these. If you don’t like music these won’t help.

**AKG K712 Pro**

Comfort and build: Very comfortable, though I wish the cups were a little bigger and/or deeper. The mini XLR connector is annoying and stupid. You basically have to use them with a Modmic for gaming or DIY a 3.5mm jack. If they weren’t fancy and came with two mini-XLR cables I’d swap them. Also the non-coiled cable is annoyingly long. 

Amplification: 8/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Yeah these are pretty much reference headphones. I’m betting nicer amplification (i.e. Schiit Magni) would help with the dynamic range. 

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Here we hear some bass. The mid-bass region has good transients, can hear the resonance on the bass synth in the initial verse. In the main chorus it has that excellent sense of faking speakers. For some it’s unnatural, which I understand, but I’ve always been a fan of that. 

Bonus: hidden synth in the right channel isn’t that noticeable. 

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

The ‘teardrop’ percussion sounds so full, the mid through the highs. I mean it’s a perfectly mixed song on reference headphones.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

It’s now when you notice the issue with bass on open-back dynamic headphones. The song compensates for the sobriety.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

This song isn’t as well mixed seemingly. Still, the ethereal elements are all there. I think these headphones are in a sense boring, which means you can easily just get lost in the song rather than listening for issues with the source.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Instrument separation: check. Sense of fate: double check. I will say the mids and bass seem to overlap a bit in the outro/exposition with the bass drum and the horns.

Overall: We all know this is the point of diminishing returns, especially when you buy these used, which I did. I wish the soundstage were a wee bit bigger. The only headphones I’ve had before that I remember being ‘better’ would be Sennheiser HD800/S. These seem less fragile, though that’s likely bias from price tag difference. If anyone wants to test 

**Audio Technica AD900x**

Build and Comfort: The wing design works for me, the only issue is if it gets off balance the cups can price down on my ears (from the top). I just have to make sure it’s well adjusted every 20 minutes or so.

I DIY’d them to have a removable jack. 

I’ve had these on and off for close to 10 years now. They’re typically my gaming headset but they were also my first legit headphones, so in a sense they’re a reference pair for me. I’m romantic about them, maybe I am a weeb.

Amplification: 5/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Artificial imaging and sounds awesome.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

So you might have heard these have no bass. They don’t extend deep, but there does seem to be a slight boost in the midbass. It’s satisfying without listening too loudly.

The hidden synth is back! Probably the best of the bunch.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Absolutely filthy. Sounds so good, really feels like a set of speakers in a big room. The bass is satisfying because of the attack/decay of the kick drum and bass combo. The outro sounds particularly good.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

The bass is full, but something feels like it’s missing. It doesn’t sound as crunchy in the obnoxious part. Still, I could still be flying Turkish Airlines. Details (treble transients) could be better.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

I thought it was always weebs trying to impose their love of female vocals, but yeah, the correct frequencies are brought forth. I’m realizing these are like Grados for people who value fidelity. Bass is nice too.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

I heard this song on these headphones back in the day, and I’d listen to it on repeat. Still feels the same, which says a lot about the song, and a lot about the headphones. 

And the fact that I said that says a lot about me.

**BONUS: Audeze Penrose X**

Since I’m now a shill that’s deleted his post for more upvotes on the second go, I have a pair of Penroses that I need to return. Initial impressions: Bluetooth isn’t brilliant, and you need to update firmware, otherwise you keep hearing ‘connected’ while the dongle is plugged into another device (in my case, an Xbox). There is a ton of hiss on the right channel when nothing is playing. There’s a slight hiss in the V-Modas too, but this is unacceptable.

The controls are odd. I don’t know why they had an encoder vs. a regular attenuator with hard stops. That means when you adjust volume on the microphone or headset to the maximum or minimum there are no hard stops. You’ll keep scrolling the wheel after you’ve hit max.

Comfort isn’t great. After about 30 minutes I can feel the top pressing into my head. I wish the headband had been deeper. I don’t have issues with my V-Modas, and the K712s do press against my head, just not this much. Clamping is fine.

Amplification: 4/16. Using Bluetooth this time because not sure the MBP has enough juice for planars.

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Tons of detail. The decay in the reverb is more apparent. There’s a nice heft to some of the lower-mid/upper-bass notes. 

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Ah, planar bass, the reason I bought these headphones. Great transients in the low end, far exceeding the rest. For a track that’s a little congested these headphones don’t do much extra, except add campy aesthetics. Considering the only people wearing these are sweats in their bedrooms I’m surprised they even bothered to soup up the Mobius to look worse.

Some aspects of treble are more in your face, without getting too shrill. Hidden right channel synth is present at the end. These are probably the most fun headphones for this song.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Something seems not quite as bright in the upper mid/lower-treble. You can tell the decay on the bass is way tighter than the dynamics. There isn’t more than the V-Modas, so if your’e looking for a pair of headphones that can do double duty for looking like a gamer and getting a nice FR for music, look no further.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Almost like being in a field with the drummer. Transients are so good. The soundstage isn’t massive, but if something is panned hard you hear it. 

The spike in the treble is back. It’s a bit much, and at times seem ‘crunchy’. And not in the Ronald Jenkees way.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

The vocals are more present than they’ve been in the other headphones. Imaging is still really nice, these headphones work well with this song. 

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Again, details are great, especially in the treble. I’d say these are in line with the AKG’s but just a planar, closed back version. The soundstage isn’t as wide as them, but it all seems pretty believable. You do still get the sense that you’re listening through headphones.

Overall: After listening to music closely I almost want to keep them. However the silent Bluetooth hiss is super annoying, and I do think Audeze should offer these as open-backs.  Then they’d be better for gaming by reducing some of the bass (which is over the top in the games I play) and increasing the soundstage width, and they’d also have to eliminate the hideous print on the cups. Also the headband isn't brilliant. I'd need to crochet a lime green and black headband cover to make them work.

headphones,"KZ ZEX Pro (x Crinacle) Review. They tried I don’t really know much about cheap headphones, and I feel it’s important to admit it right away. Well, it’s not that I know nothing about cheap *Chinese* ones, but I’ve only heard the names of some manufacturing companies.

But when the KZ ZEX Pro (aka KZ x Crinacle CRN) came out, I got curious: Crinacle being mostly engaged in headphones measuring and analyzing, together with KZ produces a hybrid model with neutral tuning, and all that for around $30. The headphones motto says ‘You don’t need to pay for tuning’: that is, the right tuning is available for any, even small money.

So I rushed to AliExpress and ordered these.

&amp;#x200B;

#  What’s included &amp; specifications

The headphones come in a very simple rather small box. There are a 2-pin (0.75 mm) cable with a 3.5 jack and three pairs of earpads inside. Headphones’ technical specs:

* Design: in-ear closed-back.
* Drivers: 1 dynamic, 1 armature, 1 electret.
* Impedance: 25 Ohms.
* Sensitivity: 104 dB.
* Weight of a single earpiece: 7 grams.

## Ergonomics and manufacturing quality

The headphones are made of glossy transparent plastic, the shell is opaque matte (black and gold versions available). As for the fit, it’s an ambiguous experience: those ‘wings’ protruding from the enclosure put a lot of pressure on my ears.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkxs8pdld9a81.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28357977c0a30000e080b1419b1f14ec54adb475

Moreover, these wings have nothing inside (I mean, these don’t cover anything electronic), that is, the manufacturer made these appendices on purpose — for better ergonomics (thanks a lot). Well, I believe that it’s just my ears, since the rest of the enclosures fit inside the auricle and the auditory canal quite comfortably.

The headphones are simple, but neat. The sound ducts are even protected by mesh.

# Measurements and sounding

*The measurements were performed on a modified miniDSP EARS measuring stand calibrated to the IEF target curve for in-ear headphones. The headphones measurements corresponding to the target IEF curve should look like a flat curve in my graphs. For each of the earpieces, the measurements were made until 5 reliable and stable measurements were obtained for the left and right channels; any deviant measurement results were excluded. The resulting measurements were obtained by averaging the responses of two channels, that is, ten measurements in total were taken into account. All diagrams shown feature 1/12 octave smoothing. As always, for the info about rigs, graphs and headphones measurements refer to my article.*

The frequency response of the KZ ZEX Pro normalized relative to the IEF curve  looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/140a1i9wd9a81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7540d5aa9fbcba4d36666eb5641c7a884f40750

 Let’s see what it says:

* The lower-frequency range is configured in an extremely neutral manner as for in-ear headphones. The sub-bass doesn’t interfere with the bass, and the rise reaches its maximum at the very bottom — at 20 Hz. Hence, while listening to some music (with the right earpads, of course), the bass seems to be fast, somewhat whipping.
* The middle section is completely flat, except for some small rises at 2 and 3 kHz.
* The upper frequencies are… well, pretty odd. There’s a peak at 8 kHz (+8 dB), then a sharp dip at 10−16 kHz, reaching -21 dB at its minimum.

Aaand just in case you didn’t know, such a tuning removes all the ‘airness’, all after-sounds, that sounds of the singer’s breathing, as well as the upper-frequency section of cymbals, saxophone, violin, etc. from any recording like COMPLETELY. That being said, there are a quite collected and detailed bass, wonderful analytical middle frequencies, but right after those there are those sharp and shrilling sibilants due to the ‘hump’ at 8 kHz, and then just an endless silent pit. I mean, the headphones sound sibilative, but dull at the same time: as if your ears are stuffed. I don’t even know how it can be better described. Needless to say, due to this dip after 10 kHz, the feeling of the volume of the imaginary sound stage is radically reduced.

Hoping to assess the sounding from a subjective perspective, I tried the ZEX Pro with various music genres, from minimalistic to jazz of the 50s, from EBM to Schnittke, from reggaeton to Bulgarian folk songs. What was it like? Well, you can listen to some not too energetic electronic tracks for sure without losing your mind, given that you don’t really know how it actually should sound, that is, without any actual music instruments or references to check on. Then yes, it would be somewhere around okayish.

I also tried to equalize the sound (using ADI-2 DAC), and it turned out that you actually can fix the sound:

https://preview.redd.it/erqvk7dyd9a81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde15a37125956a8e916d41d43ff41fbea0951c8

 But, firstly, the 10−16 kHz dip still remains at -10 dB, and that’s still a lot. And, secondly, the unpleasant sharp squeaky hint doesn’t go away, no matter how hard you fiddle the equalizer. Maybe it’s all about that electret driver the manufacturer used to take care of the upper frequencies and to save on at the same time, and this same driver is actually doing good, I don’t know.

To be honest, I’m not surprised by the generally bad sounding of these headphones, because $30 is $30, after all. What I just can’t understand are the usage scenarios. Like, okay, use it with an equalizer. Alright, which one to use, since smartphones don’t feature analog audio jacks anymore? The one in a DAP or in a PC/laptop, of course! The question is, why would you buy $30 headphones while having a separate DAP? Would you really connect such headphones to a PC or laptop and why? And the trickiest question is where can you get a functional equalizer capable of pulling the frequencies up by +/-20 dB?

Questions, questions everywhere.

Like I’ve already mentioned, I don’t know much about headphones with such a price tag. But I still wanted to compare the ZEX Pro with something very affordable. The only qualifying model I could pick is the AKG EO–IG955 headphones. Wait with the googling, these are just the headphones (the headset, to be precise) for the Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone. At the moment, these are no longer available to buy at stores, but are still there to buy from individuals in excellent condition for around $8. When the S10 was released, the headset was on sale separately and cost some $40. Long story short, I grabbed the headset, did the measurements and compared those with the ZEX Pro ones:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m6wxhsg0e9a81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ed3a6a5fa5849f6d31d70ad9e903511d8870f8

Despite the clear V-shaped frequency response and the huge peak at 14 kHz, the EO-IG955 sounds much more harmonious and pleasant than the ZEX Pro. Not more correct, just more pleasant. But even I, being a big fan of ‘smooth’ headphones sounding and sound delivery close to the original creator’s idea, wouldn’t think for a second as what to choose between the two. The EO-IG955 model obviously wins. Don’t get me wrong here: it’s not that the EO-IG955 are good headphones, it’s that the ZEX Pro are even worse.  

## Summary

As far as I can tell, when trying to adjust the frequency response of headphones worth $30, be ready for a lot of technical limitations. And if the headphones in question are a 3 different types of drivers mode, then there will probably be even more limitations. Therefore, here’s my conclusion: the $30 worth in-ear headphones just can’t be good. I mean, it’s the big and established Crinacle − and he couldn’t do any better for such money, so no, you wouldn’t find anything decent at all. Of course, there are still tons of listings of second-hand headphones, but if you want something new or in ‘as new’ condition…

Therefore, a separate question arises around the Crinacle’s statement ‘You don’t need to pay for tuning’ ([source](https://crinacle.com/2021/12/20/behind-the-scenes-kz-x-crinacle-crn-zex-pro/)):

https://preview.redd.it/prm9wof5e9a81.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1146bcf729a4cc25842e2923a42a0e1df4c8035b

As far as I understand, if it actually was technologically possible, the tuning would be different — the measurements of the best ([according to Crinacle himself](https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/)) in-ear headphones look somewhat different, especially after 10 kHz. That is, something tells me that if the frequency response is actually the main spec of any headphones, then we do pay for tuning. But the tuning — if not neutral, then at least digestible over the entire audible frequency range — is a serious technological problem that is being solved only in relatively expensive models.

OR we’re dealing with some sort of conspiracy between manufacturers.

And as for the KZ ZEX Pro in question, it just… didn’t work out. These are just bad cheap headphones, that’s all. But I think it’s not because someone didn’t try hard enough or deliberately chose the wrong frequency response configuration (perhaps the Crinacle is the last person to consciously opt for such a tuning), but because at the current stage of technological progress any decent headphones with neutral sounding for such money are simply impossible to create.

In fact, my thought is that it’s not even about the fact of the release of these headphones itself, but the ongoing process of cooperation between a competent reviewer and the manufacturer. And I believe that sooner or later they just must produce something decent.

4. Should be comfortable for longer sessions.

Read about Spinfit tips &amp; how great they are. They are not cheap, but I thought, why not, extra few £ to improve sound would be ok. Wasn't expecting much. How could replacing the little bits of silicone make much difference?

Well, still waiting for 7Hz, so thought I would pop a pair on those garbage e11c's.

omg.

They sound fantastic. Playing on phone via hip dac &amp; i cannot stop skipping between my favourite tracks. Sound is full, rich, detailed. Tinniness has gone, guitars sound like guitars, Morrissey no longer sounds like a metallic ostrich.

headphones,"What's your post-purchase disappointment? For me, it has to be the Sivga SV021 (aka Robin) for tuning reasons. Before making the purchase I wanted a closed back headphone that is comfortable, fun sounding, and well constructed for my budget at the time.   


On my first listen I was impressed with the soundstage and detail these had, but that impression was soon ruined the more music I listened to. For context, I listen to a large selection of genres that I probably won't be able to list. Simply, the bass is too damn loud and bloated (like 5 decibels over my limit), the mids are ""borked"" and shouty, and the treble is seemingly uncontrolled. I did not buy this for the mids, but they are pretty bad whenever the mids happen imo. I've used EQ for a more harman neutral tuning for about a week and even then the SV021 just didn't hold up to my standards anymore. And I really dislike dealing with EQ when the one priority I have is to get a headphone that will not \*require\* EQ as I switch headphones multiple times a day, unfortunately I failed myself in that headphone choice. The only redeeming values are the comfort and build quality, very good for a $150 can. A shame that the V-shaped tuning was grossly overcooked.   


Going to replace this with a significant upgrade later down the line, I might get a $500 open back and then a KZ CRN or something. I do not need suggestions from this sub, but you can DM me if you feel like it.  


I would like to know what your own post-purchase disappointment has been in the hobby. And for those SV021 owners, I do not want to give you chronic buyer's remorse but I would like to know your opinions on the SV021.

headphones,"Neutral 20-Band EQ Setting for Sony WH-1000XM3 (works with LDAC) Hi! I've had the WH-1000XM3 for more than 2 years now and I found its bass overly emphasised, to the point where the vocals sound a bit veiled. I've tried using the AutoEQ settings on Wavelet and also other recommended EQ profiles, but I decided to create my own EQ profile in the end.


I'm using the 20-band equaliser in Equalizer Buddy, an Android app which is free on the play store (no affiliation to me btw).


I'll share it here if any of you would like to try it  

(I was aiming for a more balanced and neutral EQ tuning)

Pre-amp: -3 db 

Hz:        db 

31:        -3.09 

44:        -3.13 

63:        -2.9 

88:        -2.38 

125:      -3.24 

177:      -1.71 

250:      -1.43 

354:      -0.7 

500:      0.44 

707:      1.26 

1k:        1.26 

1.4k:     -0.52 

2k:        -3.64 

2.8k:     -1.61 

4k:        -0.81 

5.7k:     -1.63 

8k:        -0.61 

11.3k:   -1.18 

16k:      -0.4 

21.6k:   0.13

Alternatively if you do not have a pre-amp setting, you can simply reduce the loudness of all the frequencies further by 3db. 


You can also watch my video on YouTube for more info on why I adjusted certain frequencies too:

headphones,"Have you ever felt a lack of power while driving IEMS? I was having some fitment issues on my Tin T3, and recently got some CP 360 - S for it. The fit was great. I've been listening to them on a BT DAC (Ugreen 80895 - CS43131), and I was finding the performance very underwhelming. Soundstage pretty much disappeared, and the sound felt very unengaging. I was thinking, is it because of the new ear tips? Was feeling super disappointed. The DAC runs my other IEMs fine, never had issues with my other ones (blons, some kzs, quarks etc).

  
So, today I plugged them to my V40, and I was speechless at the difference. Very, very noticeable. The soundstage was good, and the sound was immensely better. I tried them on my sonata hd, and the sound was still comparable to my V40, infinitely better than the other BT DAC (even when run wired).  

&amp;#x200B;

After this experience, I am convinced that some power, does help some IEMs sound better. Maybe not all of them, but some do benefit from power. The difference was absolutely noticeable. I know, low impedance, high efficiency, tiny drivers - but my ears say otherwise. I am actually convinced now to get something like a Fiio K3 or K5 Pro, whether it's for my IEMs or the Sennheiser HD 560s that's on its way. Did you guys have any experience like this? I'm curious to hear.

headphones,"My experience with YOWU so far and why I don't recommend I don't know if anyone is looking for an honest, unbiased YOWU review but I wanted to give mine just in case.   


About 8 months ago my partner bought me the YOWU 3S wireless headphones. The packaging was cute, they came in a travel case which could be handy if you needed it. This was the first time I'd used wireless headphones, of any kind so I had no clue what to expect or what was normal. Initially, I wasn't aware that using bluetooth headphones with the mic would make the sound quality poor and it wasn't recommended for gaming--this was on me for not doing my research, so really while playing with friends I was limited to using the headphones while they were plugged in. I guess this is something to consider if you were planning on getting one and didn't know also. The sound quality was similar to my Razer Kraken I had owned before, but slightly worse. If you weren't able to compare the two you wouldn't notice. The mic quality is quite terrible, to be honest, but I'm not sure what you could expect from a headset with a built in mic. I think I expected slightly better for the price though. They are RGB, but with only a few settings to control on the headset themselves. They don't have a desktop app so you need to connect the headset to your phone first, download the app, sync them to your phone, choose the custom colour (and sound setting if you like) and then reconnect to your pc. This is kind of a hassle considering every time the headphones turn off they reset to their original colour anyway, so it seems a bit tedious. The phone app has a ""YOWU radio"" that plays music though, so that's cute I guess.  


I was really basking in the bluetooth capabilities for a couple of weeks until I realised the battery life was only a couple of hours (despite the fact that they advertise 48 hours. I literally only just found this out while writing this and had a laugh because this definitely isn't the case for mine, whether its a fault or not I'm unsure). I'm assuming this was standard for bluetooth headphones, but it meant I needed to start using them while they were plugged in for long gaming sessions. Unfortunately, the usb c supplied with the headphones would constantly fall out while I was playing, literally just come loose and then drop, while I was using them. Even if it wasn't falling out entirely, it coming loose disconnected it regardless, so slight movements of my head would cut out all audio and disconnect the headset from my pc. I thought maybe it was just the type of plug and this was common until I realised that I never had this issue with similar usb c devices like my switch or a phone. It took me, admittedly, several months to realise that my headphone plug literally falling out mid-game wasn't normal for a $200AUD headset, so by this time I had owned them for several months already. I decided to contact YOWU and this is when I realised how terrible their customer service is as everyone talks about.  


Initially, it took only a couple of hours to hear back from them. I told them about the issue, they asked me to test it with other usb c plugs, which I did, and it had the same result; coming loose and falling out. We went through a few other troubleshooting options. Maybe it was just me, but as it came closer to them admitting it was their responsibility and they realised they could no longer guide me to helping me sort it out on my own, their responses took weeks, and then months to get back to me. I would have to message their instagram account and complain before getting a reply via email again. This is when I found out YOWU don't even offer warranty of any kind. Fine for a small company, but for headphones with pricing up there of big brands I'm very surprised they don't assume any responsibility considering faults seem to be quite common with YOWU, and the lack of warranty is never clearly, blatantly stated. Since being in contact with them over the last couple of months, the headphones have only gotten worse. I'm not sure if it's related to them constantly being disconnected and reconnected, but I've had issues with the microphone not being recognised, the bluetooth not connecting correctly, sound issues and more. More issues I had with any other headset in my entire life.  


They so far have surprisingly offered to repair the headset, assuming I send it back to them but have demanded I pay for shipping. I don't think I'm enjoying the headset enough to pay another $40 for shipping  which is almost 1/4 of the price of the headphones themselves. After I kindly requested they pay for the return costs, it's been about two weeks since I've heard from them. I've heard others have the same issue with them demanding you pay for shipping but they eventually come around. I'm hoping this happens here. I'm not really sure where the experience is going to end up but considering I owned my Razer Kraken for several years and had nothing but compliments for it, and they were the same price, and so far the YOWU 3S has just been a plethora of issues, I would advise anyone with low patience for roundabout customer service and poor quality to steer clear of YOWU.",experience yowu far recommend anyone honest unbiased yowu review wanted give mine case month ago partner bought yowu wireless headphone packaging cute came travel case could handy needed first time used wireless headphone kind clue expect normal initially aware using bluetooth headphone mic make sound quality poor recommended gaming research playing friend limited using headphone plugged guess something consider planning getting sound quality similar razer kraken owned slightly worse able compare two notice mic quality quite terrible honest sure could expect headset built mic think expected slightly price though rgb setting control headset desktop app need connect headset phone first download app sync phone choose custom colour sound setting reconnect pc kind hassle considering every time headphone turn reset original colour anyway seems bit tedious phone app yowu radio play music though cute guess basking bluetooth capability couple week realised battery life couple hour despite fact advertise hour literally found writing laugh definitely case mine whether fault unsure assuming standard bluetooth headphone meant needed start using plugged long gaming session unfortunately usb c supplied headphone constantly fall playing literally come loose drop using even falling entirely coming loose disconnected regardless slight movement head cut audio disconnect headset pc thought maybe type plug common realised never issue similar usb c device switch phone took admittedly several month realise headphone plug literally falling mid game normal aud headset time owned several month already decided contact yowu realised terrible customer service everyone talk initially took couple hour hear back told issue asked test usb c plug result coming loose falling went troubleshooting option maybe came closer admitting responsibility realised could longer guide helping sort response took week month back message instagram account complain getting reply via email found yowu even offer warranty kind fine small company headphone pricing big brand surprised assume responsibility considering fault seem quite common yowu lack warranty never clearly blatantly stated since contact last couple month headphone gotten worse sure related constantly disconnected reconnected issue microphone recognised bluetooth connecting correctly sound issue issue headset entire life far surprisingly offered repair headset assuming send back demanded pay shipping think enjoying headset enough pay another shipping almost price headphone kindly requested pay return cost two week since heard heard others issue demanding pay shipping eventually come around hoping happens sure experience going end considering owned razer kraken several year nothing compliment price far yowu plethora issue advise anyone low patience roundabout customer service poor quality steer clear yowu

headphones,"Does every TOTL headphone have a flaw? I've been in the market for a TOTL headphone recently and I've auditioned a number of them, but every single one of them seems to come with some kind of downside (with regards to build quality / longevity, comfort, and sound quality). I wanted to compile a short list of the ones I've tried and ask you guys about your experience with them. Headphones I have not tried will be marked with a \*.

**Headphones I've heard / researched in depth**:

Susvara - build quality, and thus longevity, is questionable (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/dulxaf/hifiman_susvara_impressions_diminishing_my_ortho/) amazing post by u/Feilong4)

Utopia - weight, lack of clamp, and headband design seem to make the headphone slightly uncomfortable

HD800S - really bright and makes instruments sound so far and small away that a lot of music seems to lose enjoyment for me (CAVEAT: I haven't tried these on tubes and there are extremely enjoyable for some tracks, which makes me want to get one anyways. Not perfect, but certainly has its own niche, especially for the price compared to these other headphones.)

Elite - at least to my ears, the technical performance is not competitive with the others on this list

1266 - I'm someone who really cares about the company who makes the headphone. I don't mind spending money on a headphone made by a company who has made mistakes and makes up for them, even if they are very money-hungry (e.g. Focal with build quality and, arguably, clipping, Hifiman with dying drivers, etc.), but if a company is as blatantly anti-consumer as Abyss, then I cannot support them in good faith. Also FR is whack (way too bright and really odd midrange IMO)

LCD5\* - according to Resolve (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJjBzsuJ9RA) around [8:55](https://youtu.be/EJjBzsuJ9RA?t=535)), the treble seems to be fairly recessed, a sentiment I agree with. Also, I despise glue-on pads with a passion.

Verite\* - from my understanding of my preference, frequency response seems kinda wonky without enough ear gain (see Crinacle's FR [here](https://crinacle.com/graphs/headphones/zmf-verite/))

**Other TOTL I don't know a lot about but have heard some stuff here and there**:

D8k Pro - uncomfortable and technicalities that don't match the price

Stax 009 - electrostat frailty makes me hesitant to spend that amount of money on one, plus FR is not the best

headphones,"Sennheiser HD599 vs HD6xx? Trying to decide. Hi, not a regular poster, but if this isn't the most active audiophile community, I dunno what is!  


So last month I purchased a pair of [***Sennheiser HD599 headphones.***](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01L1IICR2/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&amp;aaxitk=bd49fbf84ce829dbdda6fc1dc0cc9639&amp;hsa_cr_id=5146094670701&amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;pd_rd_r=4f7d70da-2dc8-4310-8867-31596007fbb5&amp;pd_rd_w=PQpHq&amp;pd_rd_wg=G4uBU&amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_0_img) Got them on sale. Love the color, love the sound, nothing is ""wrong"" with them.  


However, almost every forum post, YouTube review, and audiophile-related post says that the [***6xx, basically a discounted version of the HD600/650***,](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx) are on a whole other level of audio quality. I do have a Sound Blaster G6, which can power headphones up to 600 ohms, so it's not like I can't drive them to their fullest.  


But the problem is, I missed the Black Friday/Boxing Day sale, so I missed out paying $40 USD less. So it's no longer a no-brainer. :'(  


So my question is... should I take back the HD599s and order the HD6xx instead? Is it worth upgrading? 

Is it ""$60 USD better?"" (with shipping to Canada) to upgrade?

headphones,"Info about the Moondrop IEM waifus and their matching acrylic stands I see these posted here and there so I did some DD to dig into what is what. If you are unaware, Moondrop has been packaging their products with anime style artwork, so far individual anime girls per product. The IEMs have also had a few acrylic headphone stands sold separately that feature their corresponding waifu. I believe they are initially released at $9.99 USD, but the prices very per site. I do not own any of these and this is not a review or endorsement of any product. The post is purely meant to provide information. This is what I have found so far:

1. [Moondrop Chaconne](https://www.moondroplab.com/chaconne) - [head-fi.org link](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-chaconne.24110/reviews) - [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/bfIoPdA.jpg) - Chaconne is the first made and seems to be out of production. She is featured playing the violin and the pose matches the line drawing on the box of the IEM. She is often incorrectly named for some other IEM because they were commonly bundled with a few different sets. Make no mistake, there is only one Chaconne. She seems to be the toughest to find even on the secondary market.

2. [Moondrop SSR \(Super Starship Reference\)](https://www.moondroplab.com/ssr) - [head-fi.org link](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-ssr-super-starship-reference-review.24439/) - [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/l587qub.png) - The second acrylic released, SSR is a vocal specialist and is featured with her trademark microphone. The IEM come in green, pink, white, and silver. IMO pink or white work best with the acrylic stand, even though she does appear to be wearing the silver option. Googling around, SSR does still seem to be relatively easy to buy on the secondary market, albeit at a premium.

3. [Moondrop Kato](https://www.moondroplab.com/kato) - [head-fi.org link](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-kato-new-single-dynamic-driver-iem.25413/reviews) - [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/9P0kvtd.png) - The third and final (so far) acrylic to drop is Kato. The first non-musician of the group, it is possible for her to be a DJ, or a band manager, or perhaps just a fan. She is also visibly wearing her matching IEM, which leads me to think that Chaconne is also likely wearing hers, despite her ears being covered by her hair. The Kato acrylic stand has not been out that long, and can be easily purchased for retail price.

Now im wondering. With wireless IEMs/headsets with bluetooth, does the quality of the player even matter?

I get the feeling that the music will have the same slight compression done to it anyway and stuff like the walkman having a better direct link and most likely better dac/amp shouldnt have influence when its send through bluetooth?

headphones,"My Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (80 ohm) have very poor bass levels? I've been using Sony MDR-XB950AP headphones for the last years. But since I got heavily into music listening and want to start producing myself, I decided to get studio headphones. Those Sony ones were too bassy and muddy, so I wanted to stop my ears from getting used to unhealthy bass levels.

I got myself a new pair of DT 770 Pros (80 ohm). Of course I did expect a bit less bass, but it is much less than I expected. Burning them in for a few hours didn't help much. It makes anything I listen to less vibey. The Sonys are like listening music in the club, while the DT 770s feel... emotionless. I do appreciate their great clarity and much more available high levels, but the low bass makes the music emotionless.

So I wonder if those Sonys really just are extremely much too bassy and I got used to that or if something is wrong with the DT 770s. I read online that you should use an amplifier. But I also read that you only need an amplifier if the headphones are too quiet or if they distort, which both things are not the issue in my case. And I specifically got the 80 ohm version, because people said they can even use it on mobile. They said they don't need an amplifier.

I am driving them with my ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi motherboard.

On the inside of the headphones to the left and right of the leather padding are some screws holding in the headband paddings that is easily removed by a T4 bit. From there I cut a piece of plastic folder material to fit exactly the same as the leather headband. After selectively using the 3M adhesive the new Nugget band is interchangeable with the original! Hopefully this helps someone out there trying to solve their NDH-20 weight issues.

please tell me, can anyone know?

I bought Marshall major II Bluetooth headphones for my wife in 2018.

My wife used them 5 times, because she could not spread them. Pressed on the ears. After 4 years I decided to sell them and I was accused of selling fake. But I bought them in the official store of my country (OZON, they sell branded items at official prices)

According to all the data that I found on the Internet, these are official headphones and are not fake. BUT the label and their headband are painted black instead of gold. I haven't found anything like this all over the internet. Can someone give an order - is it a manufacturing defect or is it a fake?

headphones,"Blind sound testing of Schiit Modi3+/Magni3+ Vs JDS Atom DAC/AMP... definitely a difference I've been testing these for a week because I need to send one set back. I keep going back and forth. I will keep this discussion just to the sound differences, and I am curious people's opinions.

I have done multiple volume-matched, blind tests. I set both to the same decibel level on an audio meter, and ran them both through a pair of neutral HD560S cans. Both units were tested on low gain setting. I had someone switch out the inputs while playing songs, and I was separated and was unable to see or hear. The person also tried to trick me by leaving it on the same stack once.

The results were that I was absolutely able to notice the difference. I know some say the Schiit is warmer, and some say you can't tell whatsoever... but it was very noticable. 

The JDS is straight neutral and detailed. It basically doubles down on what the HD560S offers, and gives you absolute crisp detail, but powerful and punchy. Heavy guitar chords sound very detailed, but not heavy sounding in terms of weight and low/mid oopmh. But I was also able to hear all the layers of details surrounding the chords, the lighter background vocals, the percussion, background tracks, etc.

The Schiit immediately comes off warmer. The guitar chords have a lovely lower/mid growl to them. For casual enjoyment purposes, this is what I would prefer when listening to this kind of music. However, while the sound is warmer it also loses a little bit of detail. Some of the background vocals sound more distant or faded, and there is less sparkle. It does sort of bring the HD560s into a lovely state, almost as if EQd a bit.

I listened to various genres of music, and throughout, there was more sparkle and detail on the JDS and more warmth and thump to the Schiit. I very much appreciate both. 

I made this post for two reasons: 

1) Because I see many people on the internet saying you can't tell the difference, and I noticed a huge difference, and wanted to share

2) I am torn on which to keep. I enjoy the warmth the Schiit brings to my HD560s. However, I can EQ them to warm them up a bit. So I am starting to change my mind and think that the JDS being so neutral may be the better call here, as starting from neutral is always ideal rather than starting with a textured sound. I can EQ to gain warmth, but I can't EQ to bring back that lost detail. Thoughts on what is better for long term? I won't always be using just the HD560s on these...

headphones,"Alice in AudiophileLand - The First Signs Of Addiction This is going to be a long one so put on Headphones or IEM's and bear with me.

DISCLAIMER: This is a topic for discussion. This is not a hate post against the audiophile community. If by any means I offended you or your hobby I am really sorry. With that being said I would like to hear your thoughts but please keep it nice in the comments. 

PART 1: My short story on the audiophile world written long ( sorry )

I always liked to listen to music, speakers or headphones didn't really matter to me. Music always kept me company. Music is better than the real world I suppose. After many many years of having the same ridiculously aged pair of headphones, I decided to buy myself a nice pair for the last Xmas. The search started and I was confident that I would indeed find something nice for myself because after all, I could spend the amazing amount of  200 dollars. Long story short I tried almost all famous brands on that price range and all the types of headphones ( over the ear, on-ear, closed, open, solar-powered, stethoscopes, hearing aids, etc). Nothing really amazed me and made me wanna spend my hard-earned money. In a last attempt to finally get rid of my old set I started looking into IEM's. After many reviews and a limited amount of monitors that were available in my country, I went for the Fiio FH3. It was a gamble and I waited patiently for the moment that it would arrive. Thankfully they came one day before Xmas. I opened the box eagerly and tried them. They felt expensive and I was handling them with care.

The first song played and I was in love. The details were amazing. The notes were flying in front of me and I could almost catch them. The bass wanted to open a hole in my brain and I was willing to let it. If they were to test me for drugs at that very moment I am pretty sure the results would be positive. I hadn't had this feeling for a long time, since I last upgraded my old Headphones. 150 euros well spend. The next day it was even better, I could hear more details as my ears were adjusting I suppose to the new earphones. Everything was great but after about one week the honeymoon period started to end. I could still hear how superior those IEM's were to my previous ones over the years but still, I was missing something. The lower mid-range was lacking, the voices weren't that full and the mids weren't as rich as I would like them to be. 

So my search for a potential upgrade started. Videos, reviews, Reddit posts anything that could help me find what I was missing from my FH3. There was one obvious solution, I had to spend more. So I started to search for the IEM's that linger in the 200 dollar area. After that 200 dollars started filling cheap, after all that's how everyone is treating them. ""Good for the money"" everyone always says. I had to go further. 300 dollars, 400 dollars, 500 dollars. Even me being obsessed over this knew that I wouldn't dare to go over that so I settled in finding a good pair of monitors for under 500 dollars. 

Nothing seemed perfect even in that price range. Everything came with its own flows ( according to reviews). After all, they cost only 500 dollars how could I expect them to be TOTL quality? So what happened in a matter of days is that I went from "" I am willing to spend 200 dollars to buy some of the best Headphones"" to "" I will give 500 dollars but still I will have something that will feel cheap and just a poor men's taste of Hi-Fi"". I went from looking into IEM's like the Moondrop Variations and hoping I would be able to grab them one day, to look at them, and being willing to spend the money but in my eyes, they were a compromise of what I would have wanted. So then it's like I woke up and realized how paranoid I have been for the last days. 

PART 2: How prices changed in my mind and money became numbers

Now I understand that if I got carried away, being only days into this hobby, I can't even imagine how people that are doing this for years see those ""cheap Headphones"". I would like you to know that I am aware that not everyone is in the same boat. The economy over countries is different and also people in the same countries have very different economic capabilities. If you can afford the high prices and you find the joy in doing so and feel fulfilling then no one has the right to say otherwise. 

Having said that ( as a self-criticism more than anything else) I still can't understand how 200 dollars changed from feeling such a big investment into feeling absolute garbage in my mind. My FH3 from feeling like a premium product started feeling like a 10 dollar earbud in my hands. A few months prior to this I had built a new desktop capable of running my 3D software. I paid around 900 dollars and I was very skeptical of doing so even if I knew that my 10-year-old laptop wouldn't do the job anymore. And here I was searching for IEM's that were more than half the price of my beautiful new computer and feeling like they are a cheap man's joy. 

PART 3: The truth that I faced about the overpriced products

Two pieces that weigh 10 grams of metal that could fit in my palm would cost more than my refrigerator. They cost more than my computer, they cost more than what I am being paid on monthly basis, and still, reviewers treat them like budget items ""Good for the price"". Those are Chinese-made. I will say it one more time. Those are made in China. The material costs are probably less than 20 dollars. You could argue that you pay for the technology involved and I would say to you that a few years back I couldn't dream of a resin 3D printer and now I can buy a really really good one for under 500 dollars. 

Second realizations. Companies just charge what they think they can charge with no other factor playing a role. Imagine that a brand can make a super good  IEM or headphones and price it over 1000 dollars. Then when they want to make a budget version they mesh deliberately with the tunning to make it worse because come on what cutting off materials can they do on a 10-gram piece of gear. And even worse most of them have the audacity to cheap on ear tips and cable quality. 

To end this post.

 I will continue my search for good products at reasonable prices since  I can't really go back. I get that this is an expensive hobby but it really doesn't have to be. The only reason why companies charge that much is because they can and because we are like junkies that are always searching for a nice ""hit"". Also as a last thought, I really despise reviewers that treat expensive pieces of gear like s\*\*\*\*t and call Headphones and IEM'S that cost more than most could afford ""budget"" items.

headphones,"Headphones earpads hurt my right ear Hello, 

I noticed that headphones no matter their type, hurts my right ear to the point of causing a red bump that doesn't go away unless i don't wear any during 3 days. I tried multiple ones, using L/R in the different way but it seem like only one of my ear is oddly shaped causing it to take the pain

headphones,"What would be your dream setup? No holds bar Hello,

Basically for me would be an upgrade for what I have at this moment.

For context I use the following: Beyerdynamic DT770 (250 ohm), Sennheiser HD660s and FiiO FH3. They are paired with Topping E30 + L30 stack. Their use is 85% gaming and the rest for music, movies, other content, but this isn't that relevant (i guess).

My dream setup would be: 

* Open-back: Sennheiser HD800s / DT1990 (can't decide... the DT design is so appealing to me)
* IEM: Sennheiser IE900 
* Closed-back: not sure yet (maybe DT 700 Pro X or DT 1770)
* These would be paired with the Topping A90 + D90.

Don't get me wrong, I am very pleased with what I have right now. I won't replace them for years to come.

headphones,"Is there a standard for mini XLR pinout? AKG headphone cables have L/R channels reversed? I replaced the cable of an AKG K273 Pro, and found out that the left and right channels are swapped. Who is to ""blame"" or is there no standard for a miniXLR---3.5mm plug cable pinout?

Turns out that the original AKG cable and the new non-AKG cable are wired differently. Looking at the mini XLR connector of the cable:

AKG cable:
3 == tip    == left channel
2 == ring   == right channel
1 == sleeve == ground

New cable (""3.5mm 1/8'' TRS Aux Male to Mini XLR 3-Pin Female Audio Cable"")
3 == ring   == right channel
2 == tip    == left channel
1 == sleeve == ground

headphones,"Should I go from DT770 to HD660s ? Hello everyone,

I currently have a DT770, which I had for about 6-7 years now. I like it but the plastic pieces to the sides broke. I saw that I can replace them for 20€, but that seems like a good opportunity to buy a new 400€ pair of headphones instead ! I was thinking about buying the HD660s.

Is it really worth it ? Shoud I expect to be blown away, or just get a small improvement ? I think most of the difference will come from the fact that the Sennheiser is an open back. But I hope that I will also get more details.

I also have a question for my signal path. I am currently doing this:

Motherboard &gt; Sound card (Asus Xonar DX) &gt; Amp (Yamaha AS301) &gt; Headphones out.

Is this the way to go or should I do it differently?

Also, I see that most of you guys have dedicated headphones DACs and Amps. Should I stay with my Yamaha AS301 (which ill keep anyway since im using it for my speakers), or getting a dedicated headphones DAC/Amp will also make a difference?

Additionally, right now, I have an O2 Headphone amp + hd58x jubilee combo that is connected to my UR22mkII, which is then connected directly to my motherboard through USB 2.0. As such, here are my questions:

1) Is there any good alternative to the DROP + EPOS PC38X, preferably wireless? I am looking for a headphone/set that has a good sound stage and is good for both FPS gaming and music/movies.

2) Would the sound card that comes with my UR22mkII be better than the sound card that comes with my motherboard? I have an MSI tomahawk b560 wifi as my motherboard. in other words, should I change my sound setup around?

headphones,"I can suddenly hear little pops and cracks in music I've been listening to for years and never heard before, is this a thing with music or is there something wrong with all my devices? I got some new iems (wf 1000-xm4) and was listening to Spotify closely to be sure they weren't faulty as I have now returned oh so many headphones by now as they kept failing and I kept upgrading every few months, I love them and they sounds fantastic, definitely my favourite ones since the RHA T20 got discontinued and I couldn't get them anymore. But I began to notice little imperfections, like pops and cracks, in my music. I listen almost exclusively to rap type stuff so big thumps are hardly uncommon, but after going through all of the songs I've listened to for hours and hours at a time I was positive it wasn't in my head. The sounds weren't consistent with the beat, and therefore likely intentional, but they are at consistent time stamps throughout the song. I was pretty sure it was a Bluetooth/headphones issue, but when I got home and listened using my new grados, I had the exact same cracks. Tried all the settings the Sony's had to offer as well as Spotify to no avail. New phone (that had just been completely nuked and had software re installed) had the same issues.

headphones,"Shure AONIC 215 TW2 EQ conversion mod The shure aonic 215 gen2 is basically a true wireless bluetooth adapter slapped on a wired 215 since it has an mmcx connector. The 2nd gen connects to the shure app and gives you a full fledged parametric EQ that saves the profile directly into the hardware. This potentially means you can swap the bluetooth adapter to any mmcx iem you want and get a parametric EQ that applies *system wide* no matter what it's connected to or what you're playing. Shure seems to know this, because that specific adapter alone is sold for $180, which is the same price with the iems included.

headphones,"Suggestions for headphones similar to AKG K240S with the fit of the Beyer DT770? ($150-200 range) Hi all, first time posting to this sub! I've been using AKG K240S's forever, and although I don't think they're the gold standard of build quality or anything, I really like the sound - I find that they lean toward the darker side with pretty prominent low end, but not muddy.

Just recently, I picked up a pair of DT770's, and I thought they'd be a sure thing. I really just wanted an alternate pair to have around, something a bit more ""premium"" feeling with those nice soft ear cups. Well, the build quality and comfort is phenomenal. 

However, I have listened and listened to them with a bunch of genres, and I can't get over the very prominent high-mid range. I find it very fatiguing and, although it has some nice sub-bass, the abundance of high-mid makes the bass feel subdued in comparison to the AKGs.

I know that a lot of people love and swear by the DT770s, but I just don't know if they're the right pair for me. Any alternate suggestions for an alternate closed-back pair in the $150-200 range that perhaps doesn't have quite the prominent high-mid range? I like a nice warm low end and wide sound stage. Kind of like a ""better"" version of the K240's, if there is such a thing.

headphones,"Headphones with an in-line mutable mic I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit for this request.  Please feel free to point me in the right direction and I'll gladly delete the post.

I work from home and was supplied a pair of usb logitech headphones (a headset with a microphone).  They are on-ear, which I can't really handle for nine hours a day any longer.  I have a physical skin condition which makes having the pads actually on my ears excruciating after a short amount of time. 

The audio quality isn't of extreme importance (I do realize the irony of that in this sub, apologies), but a decent (or slightly more than passable) quality microphone and over the ear headphones would be a huge upgrade for me personally.  They would have to be USB, per work guidelines.  

And importantly, it would require a physically mutable microphone switch. 

 In-line (on the cable as opposed to the headset itself) would be very much ideal, so I'm visually aware of when the mic is muted and unmuted.  (My current Logitech set has an in-line switch which blinks when it's muted.) 

Anything around or less than $100 is ideal but I can spring for higher if necessary. 

I do realize those are a lot of parameters for the request, but I'm hoping that anyone else might be able to give a suggestion here.  

I don't have any expectations at all, but am hoping something may fit those parameters. I've tried to look online, but haven't found any over the ear, usb headsets with a mic and an in-line mutable switch.

Grado top-tier is the most confusing. I hear little to no difference from my SR225s (which to me are a nice fun listen). How can that be…

Sony MDR-Z1R was very confusing at its price point too. Underwhelming. 

Shure SRH1440 was also a let down. Been wanting to try for a while, but I was surprised that they wouldn’t even clamp well. They bottom edge wasn’t even close to sealing. 

Audeze was absent which broke my heart. I was really hoping to try LCD-4 and 5.

I have an U-Phoria UMC404HD audio interface and I'm not sure if it'll be able to comfortably drive Senny's Huh Duh Six Hungos which I want to get. A lot of people say that this particular interface can handle cans well up to 150 ohms, but at the same time there's a video on YouTube where a dude was comparing the sound of these back to back driving them from an appropriate amp and from his iPhone 6. And he says that he doesn't really hear any difference in terms of sound quality, settings aside the fact that the iPhone obviously doesn't have as much headroom as an amp has. But he could however achieve a comfortable volume level listening from an iPhone, so that wasn't a problem. I also don't really listen to music really loud (currently using HD 280 PROs as my daily cans (64 ohms) and the interface's volume knob is barely 1/3 turned up).

headphones,"Seal or Headphones? Hey. I did a post like this sometime earlier about my Beyer DT770 Pro 80Ohms. 

But in my earlier post, I complained about the sub-bass imbalance of my pair of DT770 pros. 

I wrote to my provider and they sent me a replacement. But upon listening to the new pair I didn't hear any difference. They sounded nearly identical. So I assumed that it was because I didn't hook them up to an Amp. Shortly after I got the Fiio E10K TC. But no difference. It just made the problem more noticeable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried some things, like swapping headphones and/or pressing on the sides of the headphones. I also tried tightening the headphones to try and get a better seal. But didn't help much. 

Something else I tried was to measure the headphones with a multimeter. On the left channel, I get a reading of 77, and on the right, I got a reading of 78. Is this different enough to make an audible difference? 

Would it help to change the earpads or swap sides? 

Your replies would be much appreciated.",seal headphone hey post sometime earlier beyer dt pro ohm earlier post complained sub bass imbalance pair dt pro wrote provider sent replacement upon listening pair hear difference sounded nearly identical assumed hook amp shortly got fiio e k tc difference made problem noticeable b tried thing swapping headphone pressing side headphone tried tightening headphone try seal help much something else tried measure headphone multimeter left channel reading right got reading different enough make audible difference help change earpads swap side reply much appreciated

headphones,"Using Peace EQ and REQ Lately ive been experimenting a lot with the eq in peace eq/apo. I wanted to get the most of my he400i 2020  as they dont have the best sound out of the box.

I inputed the FR of HD600 (Oratory1990) in REQ and used it as a house curve to set a target for my HE400i

Then i downloaded the FR of the HE400i 2020 made by Oratory 1990 and also inputed it in REW.

I used the eq window of REW and matched the HD600 and HE400i to the same volume (or target response)

Then i carefully set peaks (20 in total) with eq filters for the 400i to match with the HD600s FR. 

I toke note of the peaks (eq filters) and inputed then into the Peace eq (i also increased the sub bass but didnt boose it)

Now I know this wont make the sound identical to the hd600, but there is a night and day difference from the original FR and this eq version.

Everything is better from vocals to the removal of siblance.

Im very impressed with the possibilities of EQing. (Also apparently the 400i has very low WHD making it great for equing)

I upgraded my KZ ZSN Pros (1BA 1DD) to the KZ ZS10 Pros (4BA 1DD) and then the CCA CA16 (7BA 1DD). Note that I worked my way up with the amount of drivers and was always amazed how much better each addition sounded. While the first two were replaced because the wire corroded near the connections to the buds the CCAs had the left earbud slowly lose volume and die so I had to get a whole new set not just a new wire (if anyone has a good source lmk down below). I decided to get the KZ AS16 because of the similar amount of drivers but I feel it doesn't sound as vibrant and textured without the Dynamic Driver. There also is a noticeable hiss from them for a few seconds after pausing audio which I never had with my CCAs.

Does anyone have experience with one or both of these IEMs? Can you tell me your experience and thoughts on them, or anything comparable with the same or more drivers?

headphones,"Austrian Audio HI-X65 First Impressions (vs HD600/580) &amp;#x200B;

So I am very early on in my X65 journey. I am a little over 6 hours in and I'm gonna give my first impressions vs the HD600, my daily driver.  


The unboxing is exquisite. Very. Very premium. Every headphone should be like this, it screams quality. The hand checked verification card is just great, the unboxing could not be a better experience. I'd buy these again for the unboxing alone if my wallet would handle it.   


The comfort and fit is nice. Not as clampy as the HD600, but still nice. I have a small head and I don't need to move the adjustments at all and it fits and seals well. I do wish velour pads were an option. I don't like leather that much but this is subjective. Comfort is great, but I prefer the HD600. The X65 weigh more than the HD600, but to me and my weightlifting lifestyle, it's a non-issue. The leather does isolate more than the velour and I was surprised at the isolation for an open back, they still leak sound a lot so... be weary. The same if not more than the HD600. Comparable to my HE500 I used to own, leaks more than the DT 1990. The cups are nice and deep and very roomy (for me, again, this is subjective)  


Sound wise, (I am a simple guy who likes metal music and gaming, I don't like audiophile terms that much but will do my best here to explain)  
\[Without EQ\] They're fine without EQ, I think overall sound is better on the HD600 without EQ, it does feel like more bass is present with a slightly better punch.  
The mids sound a bit recessed in some areas and just right in others. Vocals sound good but lacking somewhat, electric guitars sound slightly distant. It sounds like everything is there, just lacking the ""intangibles"".  
Treble is just right imo. It sounds more present than the HD600 but not sibilant like the DT1990 I also used to own.  
\[With EQ\] Take everything I said and add those ""intangibles"". The bass gets slighty more punchiy with more nuance, electric guitars have that body behind it, mids sound more full, and the treble gets slightly better. I'll have my current EQ below at the bottom. Suffice to say, with eq, it's great. I think without EQ, some of the mids sound scared, they're there and you can tell it's there, they just need a confidence boost.   


Soundstage and Imaging: Good. They're headphones. Headphone soundstage (imo) is almost always over-exaggerated or overemphasized. The soundstage is wide enough. More wide than the HD600, on par with the 1990/Ether 2 if memory serves correctly. Imaging is solid, not as 3-bloby like the HD600 and I have no issues with playing Halo Infinite or Stardew Valley (the latter is being slightly disingenuous to real gamers).  
Instrument separation is also great. No issues on that front either. I didn't think the HD600 was bad (still don't) but there is clearly more separation between instruments.

Detail is great in my opinion. I don't feel like I'm losing out on anything being presented in music or what have you.  


So far overall, I really like them. I just wish there were velour pads for them. I don't think the leather pads are bad or anything, I just prefer velour feeling wise. I contacted Austrian Audio and they said they had no plans to make velour pads anytime soon.  


Will make a more in depth review in a week or two.

They're still worth it for the open ear (I like hearing my surroundings) and multipoint pairing. Really neat and I'm glad I got them.

I'm a bit naive as to the really benefit of balanced/unbalanced and my Marantz headphone output is unbalanced I presume.

headphones,"Headphone advice - A closed back under £200? Hi.

I currently own the 2020 version of the HE400i and use it with a V1 zendac. Before this I was using steel series gaming headphones(lol), but a friend who is an audiophile convinced me on the purchase. I've had my setup nearly a year and its been a great entry into the audiophile world. I use my headphones for Gaming(Mostly fps) and a vast array of music(DnB to Hip hop to classical to Jazz to Dubstep). I love this setup, the wide soundstage and clarity of the audio. BUT I do find that the Bass lacks for some genres and sometimes im in the mood for more bassy audio. Therefore I am looking for (I think) a closed back set of headphones to add to my collection.

These will be plugged into the Zendac also. These will be purely used indoors in my quiet bedroom so isolation doesn't matter and I never intend to use them in public. I want a more bass driven set of headphones, because I find my HE400i quite balanced, but I still want the bass to be quality bass and nothing blown out and stupid. I really enjoy the HE400i that I have and don't seek a replacement for them, moreso an addition to support them. I love the soundstage of the HE400i but I'm ok with the new pair to not have that wide soundstage in return for a higher quantity of quality bass. I'll be using these headphones solely for music because I love the HE400i for gaming, bass heavy genres like DnB, dubstep etc. I live in the UK and I'm looking for something under £200.

Any recommendations, help, advice etc will be massively appreciated. I got my HE400i and zendac literally through recommendation of a friend and didn't really do any self research. Now that I'm trying to myself I've found that there are so many conflicting opinions and preferences in the audiophile community that its really difficult for me to understand what to look at.

If I need to add anything more to this please let me know. I've tried to be as detailed as possible.

* Schiit Bifrost 2
* Schiit Lyr 3

I have the Focal Clear MG, but I'm very close to selling them.  I've been using them for around 2 months so they've got plenty of ""burn in"" if that's even a thing.  These sound really good, like 8 or 9/10 for most music I enjoy and around 8/10 for gaming.  But, for the price, I was hoping to hit 10/10 with some of my music and I just don't hear it.  I also have an HD800s, an LCD-X 2021, and a DT-1990.  The HD800s wows me with some music (jazz, classical, orchestra) and with gaming.  The LCD-X wows me with all my favorite genres of my music.  The DT-1990 is a solid performer all around, but no real wow factor, honestly like the Focal Clear MG.  But see here's the thing...the DT-1990 is less than half the price of the Focal Clear MG.  For the price of the MG I was hoping to get blown away like I was with the LCD-X and HD800s.

Most reviewers praise the Focal Clear, but a lot of the time it's the OG, not the MG.  Opinions seem conflicted, but many seem to prefer the OG and many seem to prefer the MG.

My question for everyone, is the MG too ""tame"" and is the wow factor with the OG?  Should I sell the MG and grab an OG on [headphones.com](https://headphones.com) while they still have them?  Or...am I looking for something that isn't there?  Perhaps I should just sell the MG and leave it; I love the three others I own anyway.

headphones,"AIAIAI W+ (H10 + X01) Initial Thoughts After Two Days of Use I have had a pair of AIAIAI TMA-2's since early 2018 that are still going strong. Genuinely love them and the company as a whole, especially their modularity. I have upgraded my speaker units and the earpads over the years and they always felt like new and crisp sounding with the right balance (FLAT, MY FRIENDS) after burn-in.

When I saw the W+ version come out, I was tempted to get them but also didn't want to spend the money on the whole new set so I opted for the W+ upgrade package (Modularity!) with the H10 headband and X01 transmitter which you can buy as a set without the additional cost of speaker units or earpads.

So I DO like the product but I have some thoughts additionally that people should know before buying.

**First thing that anyone should know about this product, it hisses like a snake**: 

The X01 transmitter sends a hiss to the H10 headband and out of your speaker units of choice that is absolutely horrendous at high volumes. The hiss is there basically no matter what unless you switch from W+ to Bluetooth, which of course would mean that you are not using the X01 at all. Like some other future-forward wireless audio products I have used in the past decade, the hiss seems to be a feature not a bug due to the nature of wireless transmission (i.e. there is shit in the air and we don't live in radio frequency free boxes, at least not yet) and AIAIAI even has documentation on it's site FAQ about the X01 + H10 combo about how to reduce the hiss. I am currently using their neon green cable out of the box, coming out of my 1/4"" port on my Focusrite Scarlett Solo which is plugged via USB-C into my MacBook Pro.

**Second thing, the ""Lossless"" Audio**:

Is the X01 supposed to be a DAC? You would think so reading their website if you weren't super informed on such matters.

From the AIAIAI website:

* **""*****UNCOMPRESSED AND LOSSLESS AUDIO -*** ***Uncompressed and stable 16bit connection from larger bandwith and dual antennas.""***

The answer to the DAC question is a hard no. While the marketing materials claim that the X01 is sending ""lossless"" audio, it's not sending lossless audio in the audiophile sense.  Which is to say, the only thing ""lossless"" is the original source of the input to the X01, so you will already need to be listening to audio at a higher lossless bit-rate, and outputting via a DAC, obviously increasing the ""chain"" here but with the obvious advantage of no longer being tethered to your DAC.  

My only real gripe here is that the USB-C port on the X01 is strictly for charging and cannot be used as an audio input which in my humble opinion was a colossal mistake of engineering, although I'm sure it would have made the product cost slightly more to add an efficient DAC. I wrongly assumed that I could use the USB-C input for audio as well, which I have to assume is a mistake someone else will make in purchasing, although perhaps I'm an optimistic idiot (I am) .

The only option for audio input on the X01 is via 3.5mm, although I did order a USB-C to 3.5mm cable that I am going to attempt to use to listen to some Lossless audio on Apple Music via my iPad Pro tomorrow and see if that works well.  

Regardless, these are definitely what they are billed as, *Creator* headphones. 

If you already have a nice audio setup and the only thing you are looking to rid yourself of is a long cable tethering you to your workstation, these are definitely a good buy, especially if you are upgrading a previous pair of TMA-2's and can suitably calibrate your output to reduce the hiss.

For casual listening however, it's a pain in the ass. 

**Third thing, not really for casual listening (see above, and obviously below)**:

I could never use the W+ system with my iPhone 13 Pro for instance with a Lossless audio source like Apple Music or Tidal (but not Spotify HiFi since it still doesn't exist goddamnit...) because I would need a portable Lightning DAC sticking out of my phone and into the X01 which is just untenable for mobile usage. I would consider getting something like a THX Onyx for my iPad if the USB-C to 3.5mm cable doesn't do the trick, but the bottom line is that unless you are already set up for audio at a high level of quality, you are going to have to invest in way more than just the W+ system to get the optimal use out of them.

Will report back once I try out other combinations of the chain.

I have also reached out to my contacts at the company to see if there is anything additional I can get from in terms of optimization.

**TL;DR -** Don't buy or upgrade an existing pair of TMA-2's unless you are already have a DAC or amp because you will just be setting yourself up to spend more money, unless of course you like spending more money on things you just bought to make them work properly.  Also, they hiss non-stop even though you can reduce it with calibration. Overall a nice upgrade to untether thyself but a bit of a pain to get it to ""fit"" your chain properly depending on the use case.",aiaiai w h initial thought two day pair aiaiai tma since early still going strong genuinely love company whole especially modularity upgraded speaker unit earpads year always felt crisp sounding right balance flat friend burn saw w version come tempted want spend money whole set opted w upgrade package modularity h headband transmitter buy set without additional cost speaker unit earpads product thought additionally people buying first thing anyone product hiss snake transmitter sends hiss h headband speaker unit choice absolutely horrendous high volume hiss basically matter unless switch w bluetooth course mean using future forward wireless audio product used past decade hiss seems feature bug due nature wireless transmission e shit air live radio frequency free box least yet aiaiai even documentation site faq h combo reduce hiss currently using neon green cable box coming port focusrite scarlett solo plugged via usb c macbook pro second thing lossless audio supposed dac think reading website super informed matter aiaiai website uncompressed lossless audio uncompressed stable bit connection larger bandwith dual antenna answer dac question hard marketing material claim sending lossless audio sending lossless audio audiophile sense say thing lossless original source input already need listening audio higher lossless bit rate outputting via dac obviously increasing chain obvious advantage longer tethered dac real gripe usb c port strictly charging cannot used audio input humble opinion colossal mistake engineering although sure made product cost slightly add efficient dac wrongly assumed could usb c input audio well assume mistake someone else make purchasing although perhaps optimistic idiot option audio input via mm although order usb c mm cable going attempt listen lossless audio apple music via ipad pro tomorrow see work well regardless definitely billed creator headphone already nice audio setup thing rid long cable tethering workstation definitely buy especially upgrading previous pair tma suitably calibrate output reduce hiss casual listening however pain as third thing casual listening see obviously could never w system iphone pro instance lossless audio source apple music tidal spotify hifi since still exist goddamnit need portable lightning dac sticking phone untenable mobile usage consider getting something thx onyx ipad usb c mm cable trick bottom line unless already set audio high level quality going invest way w system optimal report back try combination chain reached contact company see anything additional term optimization tl dr buy upgrade existing pair tma unless already dac amp setting spend money unless course spending money thing bought make work properly hiss non stop even though reduce calibration overall nice upgrade untether thyself bit pain fit chain properly depending case

I especially would appreciate any info on IEM tuning.

I've seen other tricks online - Tanchjim Tanya has filters that I've seen people place on other iem that take high end peaks.

headphones,"Grabbed a sweet pair of LCD-GX cans and confused on powering Hey everyone,

I saw these at a great price and figured I would bite the bullet and give it a try.

Soo my delima is: I currently use a Beyerdynamic Fox mic and plug my beyerdynamic tygr headphones into it. I use the microphone daily.

I wish to switch to these lcd-gx, not positive how good the mic quality is I wanted to retain using my beyerdynamic fox as the main mic and use the super cool double cable to the headphones for audio.

Except that cable has a large audio plug (1/4"") which my motherboard does not support. So I just go with a 1/4 to 1/8 adapter and plug into my motherboard and mooozy on? Or should I somehow power them in between it all to utilize my fox mic?

Any help would be great!",grabbed sweet pair lcd gx can confused powering hey everyone saw great price figured bite bullet give try soo delima currently beyerdynamic fox mic plug beyerdynamic tygr headphone microphone daily wish switch lcd gx positive mic quality wanted retain using beyerdynamic fox main mic super cool double cable headphone audio except cable large audio plug motherboard support go adapter plug motherboard mooozy somehow power utilize fox mic help great

The only place in California that is authorized to sell these IEMs is in SoCal. While [headphones.com](https://headphones.com) has a 365 day return policy there is a 10% restocking fee. I'd prefer not to pay $200 if I don't end up liking them or don't like them enough for the price. 

I'd be happy to buy anyone who helps out coffee, lunch, dinner, or drinks.

headphones,"Where to buy Ultimate Ears FITS outside of US? I have one slightly misformed ear, most normal earphones can't stay in, because that little area of your ear that allows the plug to 'hang"" in is too small. It's not a very visible thing but it means I can only use headphones. Some in-ears do work fine but not for more than 30-40min. 

The FITS seem like an affordable solution. But I can't find them anywhere in the EU. Ultimate Ears is a common brand here, no idea why the FITS aren't available. 

Does anyone have any idea? 

Buying via the US site is not an option, you can only choose US addresses for shipping.",buy ultimate ear fit outside u slightly misformed ear normal earphone stay little area ear allows plug hang small visible thing mean headphone ear work fine min fit seem affordable solution find anywhere eu ultimate ear common brand idea fit available anyone idea buying via u site option choose u address shipping
