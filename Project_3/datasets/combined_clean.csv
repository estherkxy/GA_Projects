0,"Bought a pair of Soundcore Liberty Air 2 and I'm having issues with the right earbud connectivity/pairing Hello, everyone

I bought a pair of Soundcore Liberty Air 2 refurbished on Amazon that arrived on Tuesday and since then my usage of the earbuds have been very limited due to the connectivity/pairing issues on the right earbud.

From the second time I use them after reseting and pairing them to my Galaxy S10, the right earbud just shuts down and reboots every 2 minutes. The only way I can fix this is to reset and pair them again until I put them in the box again and then I need to repeat this process. 

I've tried this multiple times and sometimes the reseting takes a bunch of times to actually reset properly.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

Is there a way to fix this or should I return them?

Thank you!",bought pair soundcore liberty air issue right earbud connectivity pairing hello everyone bought pair soundcore liberty air refurbished amazon arrived tuesday since usage earbuds limited due connectivity pairing issue right earbud second time reseting pairing galaxy right earbud shuts reboots every minute way fix reset pair put box need repeat process tried multiple time sometimes reseting take bunch time actually reset properly anyone ever experienced something way fix return thank

0,"wireless earbuds with deep bass like the Earfun Free Pro but overall better? Ok so I have the Earfun Free Pro and it's pretty nice, specially I love how the bass is. Deep and you can even feel the vibration.

However it's missing clarity in other frequencies which my other earbuds do better. (Huawei Pro)

I was wondering if there's an option which combines the two of them.
I was looking at the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Sennheiser Momentum 2.
I watched some reviews but honestly they all say very contradictory things regarding the bass so I'm not sure.

0,"My personal list of Top Wireless Earbuds under $50 (2022) Over the past one year, I have personally tested and reviewed quite a fair bit of budget wireless earbuds. From crappy ones which cost only $5 from Taobao to amazing ones which cost around $50-60

still, there are thousands of budget &amp; affordable wireless earbuds out there right now, jammed pack with all kinds of features and I am sure many of you are having a tough time picking the right one for yourself.

So for my own lost, I am gonna talk about the three general types of users:

* Active lifestyle
* Average Joe, Average Jane
* Audio folks

**Average Joe, Average Jane**

These are the ""Everyday"" people. Usually they doesn't really ask for much but Just wants something which just works and works well.

Right off my mind, I would recommend the Baseus ENCOK WM01

It is Compact and sports a slick design

it is Easy to operate, fuss-free pairing &amp; re-connection, good battery life (5hrs @ 70% vol), decent audio quality

It uses USB-C charging

Even though it has no IPX rating, don‚Äôt worry about sweat if you hit the gym or go for a jog occasionally. It‚Äôs tested and proven by me \^.\^

&amp;#x200B;

**Active lifestyle**

If you are a gym-goer, the runner, the cyclist, the X-fitter, the Muay-thai, the F45-er, or basically exercise, working out is a big part of your lifestyle,

Then I would recommend either the MPOW MDots or the CKFN F18 ANC

These earbuds are literally waterproof, except for MDots as it is IPX6 rated while CKFN is IPX7 rated

This means that you can bring them for jetski, water-boarding, high intensity workouts etc, they will just continue to play your favourite tunes even if they are covered completely with sweat &amp; water

During my testing, these earbuds provide good seal which is important, especially if you workout in noisy gyms.

But if you really want to block out those noise, Then go for the CKFN F18 as they have Active noise cancellation features which will free your ears from those noises

Now, if you are someone who likes to do extreme sports, MDots include free earwings to ensure they are glued to your ears even when you are doing backflips or 720s.

Both also deliver decently loud volume output, decent audio quality and more importantly, BASS

&amp;#x200B;

**Audio Folks**

If you are concerned about experience, how your music sounds, the Bass, the soundstage etc, I would recommend the X-Mini Liberty+ Wireless Earbuds

Even though it uses 6mm Graphene-coated dynamic drivers. But these tiny guys are powerful.

They deliver good strong bass but not overpowering the treble.

When I listen to Pop and R&amp;B, these bring out the bass for a more satisfying listen.

Even when it comes to EDMs, these earbuds further accentuate them. Even though the sub-bass may not satisfy audiophiles but imo, it would definitely satisfy most bass lovers

Vocals are clear and doesn‚Äôt sound muddy

Sound stage is good. The instruments are spread out in a wide space. This tiny guys also support Qualcomm Aptx¬†

Finally, with a battery life of nearly 10 hours on a single charge and the case providing an additional 45 hours of playtime. You definitely don‚Äôt need to worry about that 8-hour playlist which your Airpods Pro will never be able to complete.

So honestly there are so many earbuds I have reviewed in 2021 and up till the making of this video, I have tested over 50 pairs. But this list is surprisingly easy to make as these are the fellows which left an impression on me throughout 2021. And they have always been at the top of my list.¬†

ButI hope this helped you to pick the right budget Wireless earbuds. Those are my choices. Let me know what are your own top wireless earbuds (under $50)

0,"Silicone-capped in-canal buds hurt me; I need BT buds more like standard Airpods I'm looking for some bluetooth earbuds but, other than standard Airpods, I'm having a hard time finding anything that doesn't do the thing where it sits in your ear canal with an inverted silicone cup sealing it off and holding it in place with pressure against the walls of the canal.

Unfortunately I can only wear in-canal buds for a very short time before they become painful. I need the more classic kind of earbud where it's cupped and held in place at the opening of the canal by the outer cartilage of the ear, like standard Airpods are.

And yes, Airpods themselves are an obvious option. They're a good product. The problem is that I don't care for how Apple does business and especially how it handles tech support, so I prefer not to buy their products (let's not get into it, ok?). So that's a last-resort choice for me. I'd prefer to see what other options I have.

If anyone has any leads, I'd really appreciate it.

0,"Why do all my bluetooth earbuds sound bad on windows? A while back I got a pair of galaxy buds 2 and they sounded great on my phone. Unfortunately I lost them and I got a pair of lg fp5s as a replacement and they also had pretty good audio quality, at least on my phone.

Every time I tried to connect my galaxy buds 2 to my laptop though, they would sound pretty bad. It wasnt really all that noticable when I was just watching a youtube video or talking on discord, but every time I tried to listen to music on spotify, the high end always seemed really noticably low quality. I dont really know what the thechnical terms are but it was like all the high frequency sounds were all distorted, and it really ruined the experience. Same goes for now when I try to use my fp5s. 

All the articles on the internet I've seen so far say to make sure that I'm in stereo mode, not hands free mode, which I did, and still the problem remains.

I take another Discord call later in the day, and suddenly the audio quality is *INSANELY low*. Best comparison I can make is like, a 2002 Flash movie.

0,"Wireless earbuds that fit like wired I am on the hunt for good wireless earbuds that are not big and bulky and heavy so I can actually wear them. The job I'm doing is an office job that requires a lot of moving, so the extra mobility of a wireless earbud is important. The problem is all wireless earbuds I can find have giant bulky things BEHIND the part that goes in your ear where all the technology bits are. I want something lightweight and streamlined so they don't hurt my ear. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/keo5mjmg1la81.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07ef1267b0b9f35b73e64a806b1ba5c23ae1620

The shape of these wired earbuts is a perfect design. The plastic doesn't flare out past the silicone that fits in your ear and the hard bit that goes down to the wire is not sitting directly on the cartilage. Those two things together make sure it doesn't irritate the cartilage. I have yet to find a pair of wireless earbuds without either a giant flared base that sits directly on the cartilage OR a frustrating hard bit that sits directly on the cartilage. 

I'd prefer something like this with the traditional silicone seal bit (rather than the weird slide thing that the airpods have) because it fits better and is softer on the cartilage. I have sensitive ears and a bunch of hard plastic on the cartilage is a nightmare. 

Anyone have suggestions? 

I hate those neckbands too because I only wear them in one ear so I can listen to music at work but still be alert to what is happening around me and the needs of the office. So if I'm only wearing one of those, it will get cumbersome as if I'm using wired earbuds quickly..",wireless earbuds fit wired hunt wireless earbuds big bulky heavy actually wear job office job requires lot moving extra mobility wireless earbud important problem wireless earbuds find giant bulky thing behind part go ear technology bit want something lightweight streamlined hurt ear b keo mjmg la auto f ef b b f b e b ba c ae shape wired earbuts perfect design plastic flare past silicone fit ear hard bit go wire sitting directly cartilage two thing together make sure irritate cartilage yet find pair wireless earbuds without either giant flared base sits directly cartilage frustrating hard bit sits directly cartilage prefer something traditional silicone seal bit rather weird slide thing airpods fit softer cartilage sensitive ear bunch hard plastic cartilage nightmare anyone suggestion hate neckband wear ear listen music work still alert happening around need office wearing cumbersome using wired earbuds quickly

0,"Looking for VERY Uncommon Features Hey folks! I am so glad that there is a community for earbuds here on Reddit. I sincerely hope y'all can help me out. I am looking for a pair of TWS earbuds but my use case seems to be very unique and there really don't seem to be a lot of products I've been able to find that would fit my needs. Here are the features I need:

* Independent function. I only wear one bud at a time so I'm not willing to use a pair with a master/slave relationship because then I am essentially paying for two and getting one bud.
* No mirroring. In addition to only wearing one at a time, I almost exclusively wear them in my right ear. This means that to be able to put them both to good use, they can't be mirrored. They need to be interchangeable.
* They must be LOUD! I use these mostly for biking and I listen to almost exclusively YouTube videos, podcasts, and audiobooks. this means that since I'm not really appreciating music or anything, they really don't need to be super great sound quality but I need them to be loud since I am typically listening very actively to my media.
* Price. I'm not going to be a huge stickler on this one but to avoid this having to be a thing I need every couple years when my previous one wears out, I was hoping to buy several pairs once I find a set that works for me. So I'm probably not going to be able to buy like 3 sets of $200 buds. That said, most of the higher-end ones don't have the independent function that I need so they mostly eliminate themselves.

Right now I am using the Kurdene brand S8 buds and would love to buy those again but much like my Losei buds from way back in the day, it seems that their newer ones are all lighter and SIGNIFICANTLY quieter. The buds I have are dying so I am looking to find another bud style that works and fits my criteria.",uncommon feature hey folk glad community earbuds sincerely hope help pair tws earbuds case seems unique seem lot product able find fit need feature need independent function wear bud time willing pair master slave relationship essentially paying two getting bud mirroring addition wearing time almost exclusively wear right ear mean able put mirrored need interchangeable must loud mostly biking listen almost exclusively youtube video podcasts audiobooks mean since appreciating music anything need super great sound quality need loud since typically listening actively medium price going huge stickler avoid thing need every couple year previous wear hoping buy several pair find set work probably going able buy set bud said higher end one independent function need mostly eliminate right using kurdene brand bud love buy much losei bud way back day seems newer one lighter significantly quieter bud dying find another bud style work fit criterion

* [Jabra Elite Active 75t](https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-active-75t) \- This was my first pair and I was hoping that they'd magically fit after years of wingtip headphones...they didn't.

I've been considering the [Jaybird Vista 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3G74MY/?coliid=I3W194DUV06J3L&amp;colid=EA2I2JLFAGS3&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im) (pricey with subpar reviews) or the [Bose Sport Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CJCTG6Z/?coliid=I3302KJUXBQ2WR&amp;colid=EA2I2JLFAGS3&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it&amp;th=1) (even more pricey), but was ideally hoping to spend &lt;$100.

0,"Light wireless earbuds like BeatsX? Hi, I've had 3 BeatsX over like 7-8 years and loved the simple, comfortable design and LACK of annoying 'smart' features and need for apps and shit, just plain wireless earbuds with decent sound. Half of mine stopped working and I'm looking for a replacement

I just got the BeatsFlex since the X was discontinued and was disappointed to see that they're a lot more cheaply made, chunkier, and have this dumb smart feature that pauses your music for you when they hang down (and you have to wait for them to register that they're in your ear again to resume) *dumb* imo. And even sound worse than my X. I'm returning them.

Anything else out there that

\-Does not have a stupidly chunky neckband or control pads- is light and slim like BeatsX.

\-Has no 'sporty' wings to on the earbuds

\-Is not 'true' wireless i.e. Not seperate earbuds, I want them connected with a wire so I can just drop it around my neck and not worry about losing them

\-Does not have any 'smart' features or apps at all, just plain multi-device functionality

0,"Spinfits CP1025 for TWS Earbuds! (&amp; Comparison Against CP100+, CP360) **TLDR:**
If you're on the fence between Spinfit CP100+/CP360/CP1025 for TWS buds, I'd wholly suggest the CP1025s for the checkout cart. The comfort is sublime compared to the other two variants and it'll fit most charging cases. 

Only exception is if you absolutely know that your TWS will hurt if it's placed deeper into the ear, then the CP100+ is the better option.

The CP360 IMO is really a fallback option if your ears will hurt with deep(er) buds placement **and** if your charging case will most likely not accommodate the CP100+.

**Detail:**
Spinfits are great aftermarket eartips but they aren't exactly cheap either. With many models to select from, it can be difficult to choose with a tighter budget. I have 3 variants on-hand, the CP360s, CP100+ &amp; CP1025 and after trying them all. I think I can safely suggest the CP1025 as the most versatile &amp; value-for-cash variant for all-round use.

**The Issue:**
Many TWS out there are absolutely fantastic for their prices to bring wireless sound for mobile use. But a persistent problem for myself has always been fit. 

I had long disliked in-ear closed-style buds due to the 'goldfish bowl' effect of having your ears plugged, but for effective ANC to occur, this style is pretty much mandatory now. The fit on these though have always caused me trouble with stock tips. Either they do not stay in-ears or they clog the ears up very uncomfortably for longer durations.


**Enter Spinfits:**
Recently, after much online recommendations, I've taken the plunge on Spinfits and I do not understand why manufacturers do not collaborate more often with them for silicone eartips. The comfort of these are way better than any stock tips I've used.

The issue however, is that there are multiple choices of Spinfits to choose from &amp; it's not easy to tell at a glance on their value proposition.

**CP360:**
This is the variant that usually gets recommended for TWS buds, but I actually find this as the weakest compromise. It's not  tall enough to achieve a seal easily and it's not soft enough to give comfort for deep placement

What results is a weird middle ground where the buds need to be inserted deeper for the secure seal which increases the stuffy and clogged feeling as more of your ear canal gets occupied. It's still more comfortable than stock tips, but leaves more to be desired.

**CP100+:**
These are more advertised towards wired IEMs rather than TWS as some charging cases simply won't accommodate their larger size.

However, the CP100+ gives me the best and easiest seal out of all 3 variants. It's tall height also means I don't have to insert the buds as deeply to achieve said seal and allows the tips to actually ""spin"" at a better angle to fit my ear canals, providing wat better comfort than the CP360s

The passive noise isolation is superb even while reducing the 'goldfish bowl' effect from such in-canal design.

If it were not for the fact that several charging cases cannot accommodate the CP100+, it'll be my personal recommendation for Spinfits for TWS.

I've not tried the original CP100 variant, but from what I gather, the Plus uses medical-grade silicone for best results against skin irritations.

**CP1025:**
These puppies are a real nice surprise. Given that I didn't enjoy the CP360s as much as the CP100+, I thought I would be let down by the even shorter height that would necessitate an even deeper earbud insertion for the seal.

However, the softness and flexibility of the silicone really overcame the discomfort of deeper placement &amp; it's by-far the most comfortable of all Spinfits I tried. It really alleviates *a lot* of the discomfort of in-ear buds, whether wired or wireless, in the first place.

The tradeoff is that cause the silicone is thinner for the softness, it doesn't provide as effective passive noise isolation than the CP100+, but the ability to wear &amp; enjoy the tunes in way better comfort outstrips any little loss of noise isolation. The comfort of these really cannot be overstated which really brings new life in my use of TWS earbuds.

**Conclusions:**
If I can only choose one variant without knowing how Spinfits are in the first-place, then the CP1025 would be the safest recommendation in terms of versatility &amp; compatibility (except for AirPods Pro &amp; Galaxy Buds Pro, which needs the adapter also sold by Spinfit).

If somehow you absolutely need the max passive noise isolation from Spinfit silicone tips then CP100+ are the next option; CP360 if you can foresee that the charging case won't accommodate the CP100+.

Nevertheless, all 3 variants are good in their own right and use cases and above all, way more comfortable than any stock tips due to their ""spin"" design.

0,"Two issues I discovered after using the Realme Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds after just 1 day Hi everyone!

  
Two days ago... I unboxed the REALME Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds...Charged it up and started testing it....  
After using it for a day... I realised two issues

* The ANC OFF/ON control
* A compromise to a modern-day wireless earbuds basic functionality

**1) The ANC OFF/ON control**

In order to Toggle ANC ON/OFF, you need to do it before you play any music or watch any video.If you are listening to music or watching a video, you need to pause first, and then Toggle ANC ON/OFF  
which to me, is kinda troublesome because I didn't have such issues with other ANC wireless earbuds around this price range.But if you are someone who don't Toggle ANC ON/OFF frequently, then this is not really an issue.

  
**2) A compromise to a modern-day wireless earbuds basic functionality**

And that is the Built-in Microphone.I was able to use the built-in mic to record audio with my iPhone.I was able to use the built-in mic to record WA audio.But I cannot use the built-in mic for a normal phone call, which to me is a major compromise on a modern-day wireless earbuds' basic functionality.  
But if you are someone who will remove your earbuds before you answer a call and talk directly into the Phone's built-in mic, then that is not an issue at all.

  
So I hope that those of you who are considering to get the REALME Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds.... do consider the two issues I highlighted above.

  
CHEERS!

0,"Best for comfort and fit around 100? After trying multiple earbuds and watching tons of review videos, I'm struggling to find something that works. I was hoping this group could help!

Top priority for me is comfort and stability/fit. I thought I'd found the perfect fit with the pixel buds but the right one wouldn't stay in. Good sound is great. ANC/ambient and decent call quality are nice to have.

Some that I've tried that didn't work out due to fit:
- L3P (too huge)
- Earfun (go way too far into my ear for comfort)
- LP9 Tone (fall out)
- Jabra 75t (fall out/ear plug feeling)

I made the phone forget the devices and pairing a new device again but still saw two new devices.

I tried resetting the T2 as per user manual, with five taps on both earbuds while in their pod. i saw the correct LED flashing but still see two devices in Android's pairing view.

I then used the computer to list existing devices and saw two ""addresses"" (not sure about proper name there, it's a 48 bit number listed as hex digits) whereas before I only had one. To be more clear I only ever had `6C:0D:E1:7D:D8:BA` and now have `6C:0D:E1:77:AB:2E` as well.

0,"Recommendations/guidance on earbuds for calls in noisy environments Hi all,

I have very little experience in buying earbuds, so I'm hoping for advice from someone who actually knows what they're doing :-).  I'd love a specific recommendation, but I'll take advice for how to search on my own.

I'm looking to buy earbuds with a mic that works well for noisy environments.  I'm not very picky about how well I hear the call; what I care about is that my boss doesn't realize I went out for a walk.  Is there a specific technology that I should look for, that narrows this down?

I also need them to be wired, because Bluetooth tends to flake out on me at the worst moments.  But it seems to me that some earbuds have detachable cables.  Is this a gimmicky selling point, or does this stuff actually work well?  Because it would be nice to be able to take the cables off when I don't need the high level of reliability.

Side note: in this type of situation, like the Sure Aonic 215 Gen 2 ([https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/earphones/aonic215](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/earphones/aonic215)), where the hell is the microphone located?  Because the website makes it kinda look like there's a mic both in the earbuds themselves, and also on the cable.  How does this work in practice?

And, of course, then there's the budget.  I'd like to keep it under $150, but I don't know if that's doable with my requirements.  So I'm open to finding out I'm naive and need to spend more to get what I want.

TL;DR: how do I find earbuds that meet these criteria?

1. Mic works well in noisy environments. (Are there specific technologies that help with this?)
2. Wired, but preferably detachable cable.  (Also, does this feature actually work well?)
3. Budget preferably under $150, but open to suggestions

\- They can't block outside noise, so nothing that ""plugs in"" to the ears. Her current earbuds are like the Microsoft Surface style - they sit in the ear but don't block the ear canal. She needs to be able to track sound around her.

\- They need a cord that connects the two earbuds. She walks to her fitness classes but doesn't carry a bag and needs to be able to toss them on a bench with her jacket when she gets to her classes. She's afraid of losing individual earbuds.

\- She rarely listens to music, so as long as the sound quality is \*decent\* she's okay. 

\- They should be easy to charge and easy to pair and operate.

H√° certas palavras que usamos de forma intercambi√°vel, tais como efeito e efeito, ou eficaz e eficiente. E, claro, √† primeira vista, eles soam e significam a mesma coisa. Mas o problema √© que eles n√£o o fazem. O mesmo se aplica aos fones de ouvido e [fones de ouvido](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultadores).  


Na verdade, s√£o um grande exemplo de palavras que podem ser descritas como ""semelhantes, mas diferentes"". O que, n√≥s acabamos de lhe dar um tiro na cabe√ßa? Bem, o fato de voc√™ estar aqui indica que j√° teve algumas d√∫vidas.  


N√£o importa se voc√™ encontrou nosso guia tentando encontrar os melhores [earbuds](https://jolypops.com/collections/earbuds) baratos ou procurando por fornecedores de fones de ouvido populares. O que importa √© que voc√™ quer saber como estes dois itens supostamente id√™nticos diferem. Voc√™ encontrar√° todas as respostas abaixo.

## Earbuds

O termo ""fones de ouvido"" √© usado para descrever um pequeno dispositivo de pl√°stico ou metal usado para ouvir m√∫sica ou outras fontes de √°udio. Os Earbuds tamb√©m s√£o conhecidos como monitores intra-auriculares e telefones de canal.  


Os Earbuds s√£o bastante populares, especialmente entre os jovens e aqueles que usam seus dispositivos para exerc√≠cio. Eles s√£o confort√°veis de usar e v√™m em todos os tipos de cores e formas. Neste sentido, eles t√™m muito em comum com os fones de ouvido e os fones de ouvido, mas diferem significativamente.  


A principal diferen√ßa entre fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido √© que os fones de ouvido s√£o usados dentro da orelha. Os fones de ouvido, por outro lado, s√£o usados por cima dos ouvidos. Uma not√°vel exce√ß√£o s√£o os fones de ouvido intra-auriculares, que s√£o basicamente protetores auriculares.  


Portanto, outra diferen√ßa importante entre os dois tipos de dispositivos √© seu design. Os fones de ouvido s√£o normalmente projetados para se adaptarem √† forma do ouvido, enquanto que os fones de ouvido n√£o s√£o. √â claro que h√° alguns brincos que s√£o feitos para caber na orelha, mas n√£o s√£o muito comuns.  


Uma das coisas que tornam os earbuds t√£o populares √© que eles podem ser com ou sem fio. Voc√™ pode encontr√°-los com fios que conectam ambos os lados do dispositivo (isto √©, esquerda e direita) ou sem nenhum fio.

## Auscultadores

os fones de ouvido s√£o pequenos dispositivos usados para ouvir m√∫sica ou outras fontes de √°udio. Embora sejam freq√ºentemente usados de forma intercambi√°vel com o termo ""auriculares"", e muitas pessoas pensam que significam a mesma coisa, isto n√£o √© exatamente verdade. Na verdade, h√° v√°rias diferen√ßas entre os dois termos:  


Primeiro, os fones de ouvido s√£o usados por cima do ouvido, enquanto os fones de ouvido s√£o usados dentro do ouvido. Portanto, o projeto dos dois √© diferente.  


Voc√™ pode encontrar diferentes tipos de fones de ouvido, tanto com e sem fio. Voc√™ pode encontrar monitores intra-auriculares projetados para uso esportivo e modelos mais elegantes projetados para uso di√°rio. H√° at√© mesmo alguns fones de ouvido que v√™m com tecnologia de cancelamento de ru√≠do incorporada para que voc√™ possa desfrutar da m√∫sica sem ser incomodado por ru√≠dos externos. Eles tendem a ser um pouco mais caros do que as vers√µes normais, mas valem a pena se voc√™ quiser ouvir m√∫sica sem distra√ß√µes do mundo exterior.  


H√° tamb√©m uma diferen√ßa significativa no pre√ßo quando se trata de fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido. Os fones de ouvido tendem a ser mais caros do que os fones de ouvido porque h√° mais tecnologia envolvida para faz√™-los funcionar corretamente, especialmente aqueles que s√£o sem fio.  


Isto n√£o significa que os modelos sem fio s√£o automaticamente melhores; significa apenas que voc√™ ter√° que pagar mais por eles. Entretanto, se o custo n√£o for um problema para voc√™, os modelos sem fio podem ser uma op√ß√£o melhor porque lhe d√£o mais liberdade de movimento e voc√™ n√£o precisa se preocupar em arrancar acidentalmente seus fones de ouvido durante seu treino ou atividades de trabalho.  


Fones de ouvido vs. fones de ouvido: Qual devo escolher?  
Os fones de ouvido com fio s√£o geralmente mais acess√≠veis do que os fones de ouvido, mas podem ser menos confort√°veis de usar por longos per√≠odos de tempo. Os fones de ouvido tendem a ter melhor qualidade de som do que os fones de ouvido, mas podem n√£o ser t√£o port√°teis ou confort√°veis √†s vezes.

## Vantagens de Earbuds

Os protetores auriculares s√£o compactos e f√°ceis de transportar.  
S√£o baratos, o que significa que s√£o f√°ceis de substituir se perdidos ou quebrados  
Voc√™ ainda pode ouvir o que est√° acontecendo ao seu redor quando voc√™ est√° usando o auricular  
Eles n√£o ocupam muito espa√ßo em sua bolsa

## Contras de los earbuds

Os Earbuds podem ser desconfort√°veis.  
Eles s√£o f√°ceis de perder ou quebrar  
A qualidade do som n√£o √© t√£o boa quanto os fones de ouvido intra-auriculares.  
√Äs vezes √© dif√≠cil encontrar um par que se encaixe de forma segura e confort√°vel.  
√â mais prov√°vel que voc√™ tenha uma infec√ß√£o de ouvido com fones de ouvido do que com fones de ouvido.

## Vantagens dos fones de ouvido

Com fones de ouvido, voc√™ pode ouvir m√∫sica com mais clareza porque eles cobrem todo o ouvido.  
√â menos prov√°vel que os fones de ouvido caiam de seus ouvidos.  
Algumas pessoas descobrem que s√£o capazes de se ouvir quando usam fones de ouvido, porque h√° menos ru√≠do de fundo do mundo exterior.

## Contras do fone de ouvido

Talvez voc√™ n√£o consiga ouvir o que est√° ao seu redor se os usar.  
As orelhas podem doer ap√≥s longos per√≠odos de uso.  
Os fones de ouvido s√£o mais caros do que os fones de ouvido, portanto, se quebrarem ou se perderem, custar√£o mais dinheiro.

## Em resumo

Em resumo, a principal diferen√ßa entre estes dois tipos de fones de ouvido √© que os fones de ouvido ficam dentro das orelhas, enquanto os fones de ouvido repousam na parte externa das orelhas. A prefer√™ncia pessoal e o or√ßamento entrar√£o em jogo ao decidir qual tipo se adapta √†s suas necessidades.",qual diferen entre fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido bn iz p auto db b c f c f f h certas

I shared a new video on my personal thoughts about the QCY HT03 ANC wireless earbuds after using it for just 24 hours.  


Regular pairing with devices through the Bluetooth menu was fast and easy.  
But to sync it with the QCY app... crazy!  


The location of the touch control area, a flat surface on the stem (like AirPods Pro) is facing inwards. Therefore, my index finger had to ""dig"" in slightly in order to get to the flat surface.   


The usability of the ANC feature is weird as well. To toggle ANC on/off, I will need to stop the music/video first and then Toggle ANC on/off. if I try to toggle it while listening to music/video, it doesn't work.  
This is completely different from the ANC wireless earbuds I have tested.

Fast forward and thinking about returning the Buds Pro and getting the Liberty 3 Pros. So my questions are:

1) How is the sound vs the two? Is the bass there? How is the music and can you really hear if you know what I mean?

2) How is the 3D audio sound on the Liberty 3 Pros when listening to music and movies on like Netflix, etc...?

0,"I am losing trust in gamesky I didn't realize until last week that enacfire a9  was rebranded by a company licensing the name palm  and being sold for $100. Then I visited this subreddit and someone pointed out that when he mentioned this on gamesky's comment section, the comments were deleted.


Today I go to look and see the gamesky listed this pair as the number one pair under $100?

Literally a rebranded enacfire a9  that license the palm  and charges $70 extra as the best pair under a hundred bucks?  That's hard to believe on its own, but even if it's true, he has an obligation to explain to the audience that these are the exact same body as the a9.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that his deal with  whatever company is licensing the name palm  has included in a contract. Something of him not mentioning that.

I can't guarantee that but otherwise why would he deprive his audience of that information when you can buy the exact same pair for a third of the price on Amazon today??  If there is a difference in sound quality, explain it! 

I'm sorry but at this point gamesky is  a salesman more than a reviewer.  I know most of these influencers will say that these companies don't have final say over their reviews and that is true. But if you read these deliverable partnership agreements, they have less freedom than they like to admit to say what they believe.

Either that or he's just choosing to not mention this.  There's no way he doesn't know, because as others on this subreddit have mentioned he's been deleting comments that mention this.",losing trust gamesky realize last week enacfire rebranded company licensing name palm sold visited subreddit someone pointed mentioned gamesky comment section comment deleted today go look see gamesky listed pair number pair literally rebranded enacfire license palm charge extra best pair hundred buck hard believe even true obligation explain audience exact body find incredibly difficult believe deal whatever company licensing name palm included contract something mentioning guarantee otherwise deprive audience information buy exact pair third price amazon today difference sound quality explain sorry point gamesky salesman reviewer influencers say company final say review true read deliverable partnership agreement le freedom admit say believe either choosing mention way others subreddit mentioned deleting comment mention

I like accurate and tight bass but not boomy or super punchy with clear high mids and crisp treble but not the piercing or sibilance kind. Overall neutral sound thats slightly on the warmer side. Decent or good soundstage is a plus too.

0,"Technics AZ60 review Hi guys,

Purchased these buds a week ago after doing a lot of research. Thought this short review might be useful.

1. Fit: They fit well and don't fall when walking. However, they are not secure enough for running or doing other activities as will fall. Also, they kinda hurt my ear cannals. Not sure if its because my ear cannals have a strange shape, or its me trying to push them as far as possible. Still trying to get used to them.

2. Mic quality for phone calls: phenomenal, so far. I am talking a lot during the day and used them for hours in different apps (whatsapp, viber, normal phone calls) and conditions (shopping centre, busy street, supermarket, indoors) and the other party were always telling me my voice is very clear and the background noise is minimal. They have a feature called Just My Voice which is on by default. It is only activated automatically when on a phone call or recording voice via sound recorder. It basically acts like a gate, blocking all noise that is below the set threshold and leaving speakers voice on. Works really well! Note that if you try to record a video or send a voice message via whatsapp, viber, etc, the Just My Voice feature won't work and there will be a background noise - it will only work during phone calls.

3. ANC: Its my first ANC earbuds so I can't compare with the others BUT it does work really well and blocks most of the noise considerably. I am happy with the results.

4. Sound quality: mids and highs are really, really good, but the lows are muddy and bass sounds like it is a little distorted. Playing with EQ doesn't help, it seems its a part of the sound signature or limitation of the 8mm driver. I would say they are not very good for bass heavy tracks. But mids and highs are very clear.

Ask me if you need to know more.",technics az review hi guy purchased bud week ago lot research thought short review might useful fit fit well fall walking however secure enough running activity fall kinda hurt ear cannals sure ear cannals strange shape trying push far possible still trying used mic quality phone call phenomenal far talking lot day used hour different apps whatsapp viber normal phone call condition shopping centre busy street supermarket indoors party always telling voice clear background noise minimal feature called voice default activated automatically phone call recording voice via sound recorder basically act gate blocking noise set threshold leaving speaker voice work well note try record video send voice message via whatsapp viber etc voice feature work background noise work phone call anc first anc earbuds compare others work well block noise considerably happy result sound quality mids high low muddy bass sound little distorted playing eq help seems part sound signature limitation mm driver say bass heavy track mids high clear ask need

0,"Tozo T10 New Model Significantly Worse than old one? So I got the T10's around 2 years ago as a Christmas present and they lasted me all the way up to now.

The charging case is also different, new one has USB-C while old one had I think micro USB with a waterproof seal.

0,"Should I buy the JBL Live Pro+? So a week ago, I ordered the JBL Reflect Flow Pro and the JBL 230NC to try them out. The Reflect Flow's hurt my ears or didn't fit good (tried all eartips and earwings) and the 230's were actually a good pick for me. The fit was great and they were quite comfortable! The sound was good, battery life, everything was good for the price. But since a few days the right earbud doesn't shut off randomly when I put both I the case. I tried everything: reconnecting them to my phone, checking if they didn't connect with the charging points, factory reset the buds, deleting the JBL app without succes... So, I'm thinking about returning these too. Then the JBL Live Pro+ seemed interesting to me. They seem similar to the 230's, but a bit better in everything. Although I have one concern. The eartips the Live Pro's come with look pretty shallow, comparing them to the tips that came with the 230's. And since the fit of the 230's was almost perfect, I question if these will fit as good as the 230's.

0,"I just bought blue tooth buds that I'm pretty happy with, but am finding I am also needing wired buds for some of my devices. Looking for recommendations. I picked up Tozo T6s, which have worked fine with my bluetooth devices; but it turns out my laptop and a few gaming consoles aren't able to pair with bluetooth audio. I prefer balanced sound and am really looking to stay around $30US. I'm hearing mixed reviews on KZs and Moonbeam Quarks which used to be somewhat of a standard for cheap wired IEMs. The main complaint I see with the Quarks is cable noise, and I move around a lot at my workstation which has swayed me away from them. I'm also wondering if there's some type of bluetooth dongle that would allow me to use the T6s I already have with these other devices at a similar pricepoint; mainly my laptop and TV. I should also mention that I have narrow ear canals; which were part of why I opted for the T6s. I could honestly go smaller as they are a little too snug even with the smallest tips they came with.  


I appreciate your time and suggestions in advance; it's reassuring to get advice from people that have likely used a lot of different products. The T6s were my first new pair of buds/headphones in general in probably 7 years.

0,"Final Decision - Need Advice Hi all, I have narrowed down my final decision to these 4: 1More Comfobuds Pro, Earfun Air Pro 2, Earfun Free Pro 2, and Anker Life P3. Below are my thoughts/concerns atm, please give advice.

(Background - I use earbuds for workouts, I don't really care about app support based on my experience with Soundcore Life A2 NC, and I care about sound quality, call quality and ANC)


1) 1More Comfobuds Pro

Positive:
- strong ANC
- good sound quality

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)


2) Earfun Air Pro 2

Positive:
- Wind noise reduction when in ambient mode, or so I heard (impt - cos I use ambient mode when I run)
- Good sound quality
- Good ANC

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)


3) Earfun Free Pro 2

Positive:
- good sound quality
- secure fit (ear hooks)

Concerns:
- not too sure about ANC/ambient (since the original Earfun Free Pro had rlly weak ANC/ambient, heard the new model is okay only)
- battery life a bit on the short side


4) Anker Life P3

Positive:
- highly-praised app(not that important for me personally)
- good sound quality
- good anc?

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)
- audio dropout issues ( experienced this with me Anker Life A2 NC, a bit scarred lol)

I'm trying to find ""fun"" sounding TWS buds, preferably with warm sound. I just got TWS1 Pro and tbh I really don't like those, the trebles can get very harsh and it hurts my ears and while bass is quite realistic, I find it a bit lacking. I don't really like EQing too much, when the base experience isn't fun to begin with.

I like treble a bit more than bass, but I like warmer earbuds since bright ones sometimes make the sound a bit fatiguing to listen to and overall warm sound is just way more pleasant for me. I have M50X headphones and I really like them, while they are a bit muddy, I like their quite warm sound.

I listen to hip-hop, metal, trap etc.

As an alternative, I think of getting Soundpeats Sonic or maybe H1, or maybe even Huawei FreeBuds 4i if I really don't find anything good.

0,"My review of blue colored 1more Comfobuds pro  Hi there. first must say i'm no expert nor audiophile and i try to put my feeling in simple words. So i was using FIIL T1XS and nothing more serious before that. unfortunately i lost the charging case and after days of watching videos i found a good deal on ""blue"" version of CBP and got it. (you may ask why color matters? i'll answer that in a sec). i try to compare these to fiils.

**1. Build Quality**   
 its fine .. nothing premium nor cheap. i love the colors and the fact that it has a matt finish. also case is very pocketable but very slippery so be careful. on the other hand T1XS is glossy and case ""was"" not as pocketable and was making quiet a bulge.

CBP : 8.5/10

T1XS: 8/10

**2. Fit and Comfort**

its somehow subjective but CBP fits ""my ears"" wonderfully and is ""very"" comfortable. i've never had a buds this much comfortable that i could listed to music for hours without earache. these don't go as deep and wont make a suction feeling in the ear.  Also I feel eartips are pretty high quality. I have a sensitive skin and  fortunately these dont make any allergic reaction. 

T1XS on the other hand fit very good but unfortunately too much tight and make you feel a suction in your ears (at least with default eartips) also eartips aren't that high quality and make itching after a while and i feel pain after 2-3 hrs.

CBP 10/10

T1XS 7/10

**3. Sound Quality**

(there will be a but.. continue reading to the end)

First time i put these in my ears i was shocked (in a bad way) because based on reviews i expected something balanced and neutral. out of the box these are noticeably warmer than T1XS and low frequencies are more emphasized here. I mainly listen to metal and pop. electronic guitars sound pretty muffled here. bass is satisfying but not as tight and overall sound is not as clear as i'd liked. some minor details sound too warm and not clear enough. also soundstage is somehow intimate. on the plus side, vocals and instruments sound lovely and warm. you can hear instruments well seperated. and it never sounds harsh (trebles are controlled). also volume is reeeeealy high.

I have dolby atmos eq in my phone but no matter how much i played with frequencies i couldnt make them clear enough. But... i said in the begining there'll be a but..! if you go in the app and select ""POP 1"" EQ, it gets MUCH better. electronic guitars now have the liveliness that i like and i even like them more that T1XS because i feel they have more texture and warmth to them which i really like. also i boosted trebles in dolby atmos eq and now they sound much better. and i love the sound now.

T1XS on the other hand sound very clean and sharp (metal EQ in the app is my favorite). it can get a little harsh but you can eq them. also i really love the bass on these (more than on CBP) .. its very tight and kicks hard. i dont like loose bass (some may do). on the other hand after using CBP i feel vocals on T1XS are somehow thin dont have the warmth and body that CBP has.  

overal score after EQing them:

Bass:

CBP: 8.5/10

T1XS: 9/10

Mids:

CBP: 9.5/10

T1XS: 8/10

Treble:

CBP: 9/10

T1XS: 9/10

Sound stage:

CBP: 6.5/10

T1XS: 7.5/10

Details:

CBP: 8/10

T1XS: 8.5/10

**4. Call Quality**

no competition here. CBP is superb and T1XS is simply bad. no matter the environment, you can have an easy call on CBP

CBP: 9.5/10

T1XS: 4/10

**5. Features**

ANC and Transparency on CBP are good. ANC reduces low frequencies very good. but mids and highs comes through. Transparency sounds pretty good and you can have conversation easily.

CBP:  
ANC: 8/10 transparency: 9/10

T1XS: Transparency: 4/10

on the other hand CBP lacks gaming mode and i wish it had it.. because i like to connect my buds to tv (monitor) these work fine but if you look for it you can see there's some delay (about 50 ms) but gaming on mobile feels bad.. theres +300ms delay. 

**6. verdict**

I wouldn't like these if i'd got the black or white color. fortunately new EQ made the sound very pleasing for me. i only wish it had so much better sound stage and details where a tad cleaner.

these are very versatile. good sound, very good ANC and call quality, and good price. i got the blue color the same price as others but does it worth more ? i'd say yes for me.. i'm happy that i picked these .. cant imagine living with default of these EQ.",review blue colored comfobuds pro hi first must say expert audiophile try put feeling simple word using fiil x nothing serious unfortunately lost charging case day watching video found deal blue version cbp got may ask color matter answer sec try compare fiils build quality fine nothing premium cheap love color fact matt finish case pocketable slippery careful hand x glossy case pocketable making quiet bulge cbp x fit comfort somehow subjective cbp fit ear wonderfully comfortable never bud much comfortable could listed music hour without earache go deep wont make suction feeling ear feel eartips pretty high quality sensitive skin fortunately dont make allergic reaction x hand fit unfortunately much tight make feel suction ear least default eartips eartips high quality make itching feel pain hr cbp x sound quality continue reading end first time put ear shocked bad way based review expected something balanced neutral box noticeably warmer x low frequency emphasized mainly listen metal pop electronic guitar sound pretty muffled bass satisfying tight overall sound clear liked minor detail sound warm clear enough soundstage somehow intimate plus side vocal instrument sound lovely warm hear instrument well seperated never sound harsh treble controlled volume reeeeealy high dolby atmos eq phone matter much played frequency couldnt make clear enough said begining go app select pop eq get much electronic guitar liveliness even x feel texture warmth boosted treble dolby atmos eq sound much love sound x hand sound clean sharp metal eq app favorite little harsh eq love bass cbp tight kick hard dont loose bass may hand using cbp feel vocal x somehow thin dont warmth body cbp overal score eqing bass cbp x mids cbp x treble cbp x sound stage cbp x detail cbp x call quality competition cbp superb x simply bad matter environment easy call cbp cbp x feature anc transparency cbp anc reduces low frequency mids high come transparency sound pretty conversation easily cbp anc transparency x transparency hand cbp lack gaming mode wish connect bud tv monitor work fine look see delay m gaming mobile feel bad there m delay verdict got black white color fortunately eq made sound pleasing wish much sound stage detail tad cleaner versatile sound anc call quality price got blue color price others worth say yes happy picked cant imagine living default eq

0,"Sony vs Technics vs Soundcore vs Sennheiser I posted this as a comment, but making a post of its own so more people can benefit from my experience. 

I went around and tried out all the earphones I'd been considering, plus the Sennheiser Momentum 2 since the shop guy recommended it. They were really patient so I was able to listen to multiple songs and make WhatsApp calls to my wife to test out the sound as well as the mics. The mic test was done in the middle of the mall, in a very noisy environment with people talking, music playing etc. 


Sony WF-1000XM4: Great sound quality, great noise cancellation. Mic clarity was really good, but the mics let in noise when I was speaking. But they felt a bit heavy / large in my ears. 

Technics EAH-AZ60: These had the best sound quality of all the buds I tried, even better than the Sony's. The ANC was definitely worse than Sony WF-1000XM4. The mic didn't let any noise in, but voice clarity wasn't great. This was a bit surprising since I'd heard great things about their mics. Overall the worst mic amongst the buds I tried (not bad by any means). Fit was really good, they felt light and small.

Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro: You're right, they don't carry the Air 3 Pro. Sound quality was not very good. There was a lot of bass, but it was poor quality base, quite bloated. ANC was significantly worse than Technics EAH-AZ60. Mic quality was great, with good voice clarity as well as background noise suppression. The best mic amongst the buds I tried. Fit was good, not as nice feeling as the Technics, but better than the Sony's.

Sennheiser Momentum 2: This wasn't in my list of considerations, but the guy encouraged me to try these and said the sound quality on these is supposed to be quite good (and I'd heard them reviewed so). Unfortunately, I found the sound to be quite mediocre, possibly worse than the Soundcores. Since I didn't like the sound, I didn't bother to test the mic. I liked the fit, the second best after the Technics.

Overall, I think I will pick the Sony WF-1000XM4, since it is the best balance of Sound, Mic, ANC for me. I hope the long term comfort on these works out.",sony v technics v soundcore v sennheiser posted comment making post people benefit experience went around tried earphone considering plus sennheiser momentum since shop guy recommended patient able listen multiple song make whatsapp call wife test sound well mics mic test done middle mall noisy environment people talking music playing etc sony wf xm great sound quality great noise cancellation mic clarity mics let noise speaking felt bit heavy large ear technics eah az best sound quality bud tried even sony anc definitely worse sony wf xm mic let noise voice clarity great bit surprising since heard great thing mics overall worst mic amongst bud tried bad mean fit felt light small soundcore liberty air pro right carry air pro sound quality lot bass poor quality base quite bloated anc significantly worse technics eah az mic quality great voice clarity well background noise suppression best mic amongst bud tried fit nice feeling technics sony sennheiser momentum list consideration guy encouraged try said sound quality supposed quite heard reviewed unfortunately found sound quite mediocre possibly worse soundcores since sound bother test mic liked fit second best technics overall think pick sony wf xm since best balance sound mic anc hope long term comfort work

Hello,  
I  want to buy earbuds preferably around $50 to Max $100 CAD. I know I  wont get a great sounding ones but just it would be great it they have  good bass and does OK job for phone calls.  Could you please suggest me  some?

I also head that most of the  wireless earbuds suffer in making calls, even the expensive ones. In  that case would opt for wired earphones.  I am been considering these:

0,"Do you know of some nice earbuds that could satisfy these requirements? Hey there,

I am shopping for new earbuds this Christmas and I would really want to upgrade to some higher quality ones for a better music experience.

My price range is around 100-cca200 (if it's like 220 that's also ok but really don't wanna go much higher). 

I am mainly looking for something that's more towards mids and highs with a normal bass. When looking for earbuds I always had the problem of getting ones that amplify bass which then proceeds to overshadow vocals and essentially downgrade most of the songs for me (Right now I have JBL T210 and it's exactly that case). 

I usually listen to stuff ranging from AC/DC through indie, alternative, classical, rock instrumental to avici and more party songs but almost never to drums n bass, techno, electro etc. At the same time it would be great if the headphones can actually highlight the different instruments in the song without overshadowing vocals (The JBL T210 I have now does an okay job of highlighting different instruments and sounds in a song but really overshadows vocals at the same time).

I was looking into etymotic but I am also not a fan of the extreme sounds isolation where I can hear my heartbeat and every scratch of the cable at the same time. I would rather prefer the standard style of buds that can be found on the cheaper headphones where the sound isolation isn't extreme so I can still somewhat register what's happening around me.

I know its a lot of things but I have been searching for a while and really struggle to find something that would fit this, so if you have any advice on a pair that could satisfy these requirements that would be super cool.",nice earbuds could satisfy requirement hey shopping earbuds christmas want upgrade higher quality one music experience price range around cca ok wanna go much higher mainly something towards mids high normal bass earbuds always problem getting one amplify bass proceeds overshadow vocal essentially downgrade song right jbl exactly case usually listen stuff ranging ac dc indie alternative classical rock instrumental avici party song almost never drum n bass techno electro etc time great headphone actually highlight different instrument song without overshadowing vocal jbl okay job highlighting different instrument sound song overshadows vocal time etymotic fan extreme sound isolation hear heartbeat every scratch cable time rather prefer standard style bud found cheaper headphone sound isolation extreme still somewhat register happening around lot thing searching struggle find something fit advice pair could satisfy requirement super cool

0,"Looking earbuds for a senior person. Are there some ""not noise cancelling"" earbuds available? I'm aware that this title may sound weird, but since my mom saw me using mine, she really wants some earbuds too.   


The problem is that she is so... clumsy. She's around 60yo, and I'm a little bit concerned about the fact of being completely isolated about the sounds surrounding her may led her to some troubles. But every model I see these days is sold under the fact of ""being completely noise cancelling"" or similar, when I'm looking for exactly the opposite.   


So any model of any brand would work for me in this situation unless for these two things;   
\- not preventing her of listening important things like I don't know, the doorbell ringing, voices around her or even a car's horn.  
\- being relatively easy to connect and to use for an old person  


Are you aware of some models that check on this needs? Am I being too paranoid and buying her any model and asking her to NEVER use it at max volume would work fine? Are any of you in a similar situation?

I take great care of them and can't think of why they keep doing this. I recently got gifted a pair of power beats pro and they are already starting to show signs of breaking(In my experience anyway), disconnecting randomly(though not too often), and they occasionally don't disconnect or connect to my phone when I put them in or out of the charger. The only thing I can think of is that I use them quite a lot and, I listen to my music quite loud(I don't have the greatest hearing so I need to). Could either if those reason be why they always break? And if so or even if not what can I try to do to get them to last longer? It feels like I kill them simply buy touching them.

- Quick switch
- Both earbuds work independently (I can use either one by itself)
- USB-C charging
- At least an above average battery life
- Microphone decent enough for video calls
- Water resistant enough for gym sessions and light rain

- ANC is nice but not necessarily important for me
- Wireless charging isn't important

0,"Wireless earbuds temporarily muffled sound on one side So I've had this problem on two separate pair of earbuds, and I am wondering if anyone has any idea what might be the cause of it.

The earbuds in question are Sennheiser cx 150 bt, and the Jabra elite active 75t.

Being that previously I only used cheap ( sub 20$ ) wired earbuds, I don't really know what is to be expected from the bluetooth ones, but given that both are from reputable brands I would at least expect for the volume to be balanced properly.

The problem is as the title describes that on both of these one side gradually loses volume until it is barely audible.

On Sennheisers I first started noticing this problem in about six months of using them and on Jabras I noticed it on my second week of use. I don't think the problem is with my ears, as when I swap the sides the same earbud is still muffled

The strange thing about it is that the problem ""fixes itself"" after I  charge them. I have noticed that sound gets muffled more often when the battery is low ( around 30% ), but it doesn't explain why is it only on one side. I guess I could understand with the Jabras as each earbud has its own battery, but the Sennheisers seem to share the same battery.

Does anyone else experience this with their wireless earbuds? is that just something that comes with the technology and how batteries work, or am I wrong in assuming that the battery is the problem? Should I return them?",wireless earbuds temporarily muffled sound side problem two separate pair earbuds wondering anyone idea might cause earbuds question sennheiser cx bt jabra elite active previously used cheap sub wired earbuds expected bluetooth one given reputable brand least expect volume balanced properly problem title describes side gradually loses volume barely audible sennheisers first started noticing problem six month using jabras noticed second week think problem ear swap side earbud still muffled strange thing problem fix charge noticed sound get muffled often battery low around explain side guess could understand jabras earbud battery sennheisers seem share battery anyone else experience wireless earbuds something come technology battery work wrong assuming battery problem return

0,"Technics EAH-AZ60 Review I was looking for a set of earbuds that had some specific features. 1) Could use either singly 2) Good mics 3) Multipoint 4) Good sound 5) Comfortable 6) ANC. I was coming from using a Master &amp; Dynamics MW07go set for reference. The sound quality is great, but that is about all they have going for them. Mics are awful and only the right one can be used independently.

The only earbuds I found that met the requirements were the Technics and the Liberty Pro 3s and maybe the Elite 7 Pros (if the update ever happened). Obviously the LP3 reviews were all great and it seemed like a great option, but I wasn't sold on the form factor or case size. Kept searching long and hard for reviews of the AZ60's and finally found 2 reviews of the Technics that had mic samples and was impressed enough I bought them from Amazon.

The Good

I've been using them daily for about 10 days now including a week of work and I love them. I have quite a few WebEx/Teams/Zoom meetings during the day and listen to audio from my phone a good part of the time I'm not in a meeting. This is why I wanted something with good mics and multipoint. I was switching between my earbuds and a dedicated BT headset (Plantronics Voyager 5200). As I've used them for calls, I've not had a single person complain or say I wasn't clear. I tested them vs the headset with a coworker on a call and they said both were good quality. You can also test the ""Just My Voice"" background separation in the app by listening to yourself with a delay. I turned some music up loud and then talked and the playback didn't include any noticeable background noise.

Sound quality is great and that is without LDAC enabled (enabling it eliminates multipoint). I do have the app set towards a high quality connection vs more stable connection but not using LDAC the majority of the time.

The earbuds are extremely comfortable and fit well in my ears. They don't feel like they are going to fall out and I don't feel like i have to keep adjusting them, they just stay put.

Multipoint works well and pauses the audio on my phone when I join a call on my laptop. 

The Bad

The capacitive touch for the ""buttons"" are  extremely sensitive and I find myself occasionally double tapping one when just trying to hit it once. I do prefer the physical buttons on the MW07 but its not a deal breaker on these and really is only a slight annoyance on occasion.

The Rest

Battery life seems to be as advertised. Single earbud use works as advertised. The case is small enough to carry around in a pocket and not notice it. As for ANC, it works but this is my first set with it so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I will keep the MW07go's around for yardwork or things that involve getting sweaty as they have a much better IP rating but these are certainly my new daily drivers.

0,"I have migraines related barometric pressure and recently started trying out earplugs to help (WeatherX, EarPlanes, etc.) but I want to know if there are earbuds out there that do the same thing but also play music? I'm new to playing around with these eat plugs and barometric shifts. I need to take note on what works and what doesn't. For example, I know I'm sensitive to increasing shifts, and this week the forecast says there's a steady increase in pressure that lasts a whole day, and I should try to wear them as much of the time that the weather is actively changing as possible, but that's a really long time to not be able to listen to regular earbuds. I'm talking, like, 16 hours. (I may find over time that I don't have to wear them the whole time, but again, I'm just playing around and taking notes at this stage, trying to avoid as many migraines as I can.)

I work a really boring job and listen to music and podcasts all day so I just don't think I can stand around with nothing to entertain me for a whole day while I have these awesome things in my ears, even if they seem to work great.

The alternative might be to wear over the ear headphones with them, but the reason I wear earbuds is because I'm so sensitive to pressure that I have never in my life found a pair of headphones that didn't over time feel like a vice on my skull, so I won't be likely to take that suggestion.

So, if anyone knows of earbuds that alter pressure like on an airplane but also play music, please let me know! I haven't been able to find any in my searches.

0,"Bose QC Earbuds Siri Prompt/Connectivity Issues I'm doing this more like a PSA because I tried googling my issues and didn't find anything about bugs or anything.

ANC was the most important factor for me in deciding my new earbuds and the Bose QC did not disappoint. The noise cancellation is amazing! I have a clicky g915 keyboard and I can't even hear the keys when I'm typing at my desk. 

But man it's really disappointing how buggy they are. The first time I paired them, I've had siri prompt at least 30 times without exaggeration. It was every few seconds. On top of that, my music or calls will keep randomly ending. I've tried fiddling around with options, updating the app, connecting through the app, bluetooth, both, etc and it got better. I found that connecting via bluetooth (not through the app) and turning off automatic ear detection really helped.

I will be returning these because siri still prompts out of nowhere in a quiet room. I was just on a zoom call and in the middle of my presentation it completely hung up the call. I had to log in to my computer and use my wired headphones to finish where I left off.

It's really unfortunate because these are so nice, but man. Has anybody else had these issues.

TLDR;

Bose prompts siri every few seconds and does a bunch of random functions. Fixed it temporarily with settings, but siri prompted and then hung up my zoom call mid-presentation so I had to use wired headphones.

I'm currently in search of my first pair of true wireless earbuds and regarding my needs and criteria I have retained the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and the OnePlus Buds Pro but I find it really difficult to chose one over the other.

From what I'v seen, they both offer more or less the same music and ANC quality, they both have around 5 hours of autonomy (w/ anc), they seem to be equally comfortable, they are around the same size and I like their design equally.

So here is my request : which one would you recommend me to buy and why ?

-Wireless earbuds with preferably no stem. If there's a stem it must be short.
-Waterproof - shower and occasional bath (they won't be submerged for any extended period of time)

0,"Disappointed with Earfun Free Pro? I picked these up last week and have mixed feelings, so would be interested to know how others have got on with them.

I got them on sale from Amazon after reading all the good reviews on here and elsewhere. I had been using a pair of SoundPEATS Truengine SE until they stopped working. I wanted something much smaller to replace them, and with the offer of ANC and ambient mode, the Free Pro seemed like a good option. But after a week i'm not sure i'll be keeping them.

The case is tiny, much smaller than i had expected, and fits easily into a pocket. The buds themselves are also probably the smallest i've seen at this (or any?) price point, and are very light. They fit well, and with the wingtips i feel no movement when out and about. I've not owned headphones with ANC or ambient modes before so can't compare, but the options are nice to have. Although i generally find i get enough passive noise cancellation with buds, so after testing them out it's not as big a deal for me as i had thought. The bass is loud / prominent (whether this is good or bad might be subjective... see below), and i generally don't have a massive problem with how they sound. Battery life is also good. 

However i'm finding the buds to be very fiddly to get out of the case, especially with the wingtips in... there's just not a lot to grab. There have also been a few times the buds have maintained a connection with my phone, despite the case being closed. I think this is due to them not being flush when put back in, so i really need to push them down to make sure they're secure. And while the buds are initial very comfy, i've experienced some ear fatigue after about 45 minutes to an hour. I'm experiencing the odd drop out too, lasting a second. It's not terrible, but last night i had about 4 drops in 30 minutes. 

Perhaps the most frustrating thing (before i get to sound quality) is the touch features. The right bud has a 2 second press for voice assistant. It seems very sensitive, and despite me having Siri and voice assistant turned off on my iPhone, pressing it still triggers the function. I have already accidentally called my landlord from 3 years ago, as well as a couple of distant family members i have no interest in talking to at midnight, despite me not knowingly saying anything particularly audible. Am i dumb or is there really no way to disable this?

Finally there's the sound. I know this is going to be subjective, especially because i can only compare them to the sound on my previous buds. I should also say i'm definitely not an audiophile. But i often find the bass to be quite muddy and even boomy, bleeding into other instruments rather than complementing them. Mids feel kind of 'loose'. I do listen to quite varied music, and find this experience worse with some styles / genres than others. I've subsequently picked up a pair of Anker's Liberty Air 2 and the sound comparison is pretty wild ( although i don't think the Liberty Air 2's sound that great either tbh).

Has anyone else experienced these issues? Am i just being unreasonably picky?

Also, can anyone recommend a similarly small pair of earbuds, preferably without stems, which maybe even have an app to adjust the EQ (and none of the issues above!)?

0,"WF-1000XM3 or Beats Studio Buds? Hello,

I've been trying to find some solid comparisons and I know these are different classes so to speak. XM3s are the top of line a couple years ago, Studio Buds are basically airpods with some ANC.  But right now, the price difference is fairly negligible, about $30 between the two (XM3 = $129, Studio Buds = $99).  Would love to hear opinions.

My priorities are, in order: fit &amp; comfort, use-case, sound and mic quality, and then case/battery

How comfortable are the Beats vs XM3s?  How well do they stay in?  I don't do much jogging/running, mostly walking. 

As for use-case...

I'm on iOS, which is the main reason the Beats Studio Buds are being considered. But other needs are gym use, work, and travel (via air). 

Work I wouldn't be on too many calls and I can be in a quiet area (I currently take calls using old apple wired headphones). 

Gym, I mainly do weights and calisthenics, very little cardio (my cardio comes from group classes where I couldn't even use earbuds anyways). 

Travel, mostly airports and airplanes. I'd like to drown out a ton of noise in the planes and most in the airport, but I'd like to still be able to hear when needed for alerts.

Sony's always been pretty solid for sound quality (I'm not an audiophile but I can def tell shitty sounds vs good sound) and, never owning Beats before, I've heard it's a lot more bass-heavy, which I don't care too much about. Noise cancellation, it's not a huge deal to me and I actually don't mind some noise (especially if I'm in an airport so I can be cognizant of any airline/gate updates)

The case/battery issues for me aren't as big of a deal since both have enough to last an airport trip and I wouldn't put the case in a pocket, more than likely I'd be having them on my carry-on or, if I'm going to the office, would be in a laptop bag. 

I'm leaning towards the Beats Studio Buds, but would like any opinions on why they would go for the XM3s vs the Beats Studio Buds.",wf xm beat studio bud hello trying find solid comparison different class speak xm top line couple year ago studio bud basically airpods anc right price difference fairly negligible two xm studio bud love hear opinion priority order fit comfort case sound mic quality case battery comfortable beat v xm well stay much jogging running mostly walking case io main reason beat studio bud considered need gym work travel via air work many call quiet area currently take call using old apple wired headphone gym mainly weight calisthenics little cardio cardio come group class even earbuds anyways travel mostly airport airplane drown ton noise plane airport still able hear needed alert sony always pretty solid sound quality audiophile def tell shitty sound v sound never owning beat heard lot bass heavy care much noise cancellation huge deal actually mind noise especially airport cognizant airline gate update case battery issue big deal since enough last airport trip put case pocket likely carry going office laptop bag leaning towards beat studio bud opinion go xm v beat studio bud

0,"Earbud recommendations for my mom? Unique situation. Some context: My mom is 60 years old and her tinnitus has worsened in the past year by a good bit. She's having trouble hearing certain voice tones now. She got examined by a nurse and was told that she would likely need hearing aids in the next two to three years if it continues to worsen at its current rate. Both of her parents had hearing aids as well in their later years, though idk if they had tinnitus.

My bf has tinnitus as well, but he literally constantly has an airpod in one ear playing music or videos to drown it out, even sleeping with it in. I was thinking of getting my mom some earbuds or headphones so she could listen to stuff while she works to drown it out, but she really doesn't like the feeling of earbuds or anything touching her ears, and headphones are even worse, so I'm kind of at a loss. I'm also worried about how she'll deal with a hearing aid in a few years as a result, but we'll see to that when it's time.

Does anyone have any recommendations for some incredibly comfortable earbuds? Like, ones that are very light maybe, so you can barely feel are there? 

If it helps to put a sob story as well for traction, my mom is genuinely one of the most hardworking, kindest people I've ever met. It's really not an exaggeration. She works 65 hours a week atm but that's the *least* amount of hours she's ever worked in her life - when I was in high school, it was around 90. She does an hour of exercise every single day - she used to do an hour and a half. She donates so much blood that every few years they tell her she can't anymore because she needs more iron, so then she eats a bunch of steak and takes iron supplements for a while and then goes back to it. She does charity work every single year. I've never heard her cuss or seen her drunk once. Point is, she's an extremely rare person, and it's not fair that she's done everything right and now her ears are fucking her up :(

0,"From CX 400 to CX Plus [Review] Hello!

I have only ever been using wired headphones and earphones until this spring. After upgrading from my 5+ years old Galaxy S7 to a modern phone, going TWS instead of dongles seemed like the smarter choice. Read some reviews and discussions, watched some videos, then finally settled on the CX 400 BTs from Sennheiser. Experiencing the simplicity of TWS for the first time was super uplifting and these earbuds way overdelivered on my expectations regarding sound quality. My plan was to use these for daily wear, commute, lounging etc, and get something cheap(ish) but IP certified for workouts. Even though these aren't very expensive or hard to find, and I'm just lifting weights and doing some cardio in the gym, I started to really appreciate these earbuds and didn't want to ruin them if they truly can't take a little sweat. Cheap but IP certified turned out to be Sony WF-SP800 when a very trustworthy retailer had them on sale for 60‚Ç¨. Pricing error or not, they delivered my order and I was anxious to try them out. Long story short, they aren't for me. Using the Sennheisers 2-3 hours a day then popping these into your ears, the difference in sound quality (and signature) won't go unnoticed. That was my smaller problem though, because what ruined the whole experience for me was the terrible fit. No matter how I combined the tips and wings, they just refused to sit in the right place, and because of this I can't really talk about their ANC (heartrough and smart pause worked well though). New plan was to keep using this suboptimal setup until Sennheiser comes out with something that combines their fit and sound quality with the features the CX 400 is missing to be an all purpose pair (for me anyway) and doesn't cost 250-300‚Ç¨. Well, more than half a year later here we are. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows, but after using the CX Plus for 2 weeks I'm very satisfied.

**What's better?**

* *Sound quality* is even better now. The 400s are a very balanced pair, but have a bit of a dreamy undertone that overshadows some details. The CX Plus makes the mids and highs crisper, that delivers a noticeable difference, especially in podcasts and audiobooks.
* Before using it, had no idea how useful and comfortable *transparent hearing* can be on your all purpose earbuds. With the 400s I had a choice between putting them back in their case like a good boy every time I had a small conversation, paid for my coffe etc, or clumsily shove one/both in a pocket. This makes things so much simpler and it's well executed as well (no weird tones, noises or directions).
* *Establishing the connection* after taking them out of their case is much faster. There's also mono mode which I don't think I'll ever use.
* Water (splash) resistance at *IPX4.* Nothing fancy, but one shouldn't be afraid to use these for regular workouts or in the rain.

**What's the same?**

* I still love how these *fit* in my ears. After a 4 hour train ride I wanted them out, but I think that goes for every deep silicone tip style design (at least the ones I've tried, wired or not).
* Charging and *battery life* didn't change based on my experience. Haven't done a 100 to 0 test with the CX Plus, but the 400s usually lasted about 6 hours on a full charge at 70-80% volume on the few occasions I commuted all day. Usually charge the case once a week.
* Making phone calls in windy or noisy (road) environments will still result in a lot of complaints thanks to their subpar *microphones.* They get the job done, but can be frustrating to both parties.

**What's worse or just plain bad?**

* Considering the perfect fit and passive isolation they provide (in my ears at least) this *ANC* is a joke. Ok that's a little harsh. This will definitely help you with quieting down the sound of keyboards in the office, or the constant humming of trains and commute in general. But this will do almost nothing when you try to lock out the gym's shitty music or want some peace and quiet in a cafe (chatter and cutlery). I don't have much experience with ANC, maybe this really is what people would call mid tier or good enough (based on the reviews I saw) but in my eyes this is barely more than a gimmick.
* Back in april I chose the CX 400 instead of the Galaxy Buds Pro because sound quality is the most important thing for me, and was ready to give up on some features I had no experience with (back then), including *wireless charging.* I'm not saying it's something super important to me, I don't even have a charging mat even though my S7 supported it back in 2016. But there were a few times when I forgot to charge the case and would have loved to use reverse wireless charging to top it off a little bit.
* Button is gone from the case that lit up the *battery level indicator.* Minor gripe, but I was hoping they would go the other way, and let us check battery status more precisely.

This is it basically. They're a really good, more sound than features focused all around headphones, and if you can get them for a good price (got mine for 100‚Ç¨) they will deliver on the value perspective as well. If not for the transparent mode, I'd say just go get the regular CX True Wireless, because it's a fair bit cheaper at retail and shares all the important aspects of the Plus model. 

Seems like Sennheiser woke up and realized there are some basic requirements and features people expect to be met at certain price points. Let's hope they will continue to refine them, because there are still a lot of things to improve.

If you have any questions ask away.

0,"Won't you please help me with my TWS ü¶Ñearbuds quest? I currently have Bose SoundSport Free earbuds -- I've had them for several years but, since last year, I've  basically been living in them. The declining battery life, therefore, is proving to be a real problem so I'm looking for the *right* second pair to switch to when they run out of juice. 

The Bose SoundSport Free are far from ideal but certain features they have are indispensible for the way that I use them -- I mostly listen to podcasts all day while I'm working, I often stream the news on my laptop, then movies and TV on the flat screen (hooked up to a Mac Mini) at night after my early bird husband goes to sleep. I switch between devices frequently.

Here's my feature wish list:

* Physical buttons or button-like controls -- no touch controls!
* Volume control, forward/reverse, call answer/end on earbuds
* Pairs to at least 4 devices 
* Ability to switch quickly between paired devices using an earbud -- no fiddling with disconnecting one device, then connecting to another device via settings or app!
* Low latency -- I'm not looking for perfection but it can't be so obvious as to be distracting
* Plays well with Macs and other Apple devices
* Rich sound / strong bass, fairly broad soundstage -- if they can be EQ'd to get the right sound, great, but a fancy app isn't necessary
* 5+ hours of continuous listening time
* Find my earbuds feature

So far I've tried and sent back:

* Sennheiser CX -- horribly uncomfortable for me, could never get the sound quite right (too quiet, too thin and treble-heavy), hate the touch controls, app was a bit messy, audio lag, extremely poor customer service, no quick switch between paired devices
* Beats Fit Pro -- no sound customization via app, USB-C to USB-C cable only, no quick switch between paired devices, must use Siri or app for volume control! Stupidly expensive for how little you get.
* Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro -- phenomenal sound and PNC, comfortable, app is great, audio lag, call sound quality very poor (left bud kept crackling and cutting out), hate touch controls
* Jabra Elite 7 Active -- decent sound with EQ in app, not super comfortable, app freezes/crashes alot/poorly designed, earbud design makes it hard to know when they're in correctly so the mic was sometimes pointed in the wrong direction and muffled my voice, case is very difficult to open and buds have to be turned around and flipped over to get them seated.

Despite their many flaws, at this point I'm close to just buying another pair of my old Bose clunkers, but I'd prefer to get something that's a bit more technologically and aesthetically up to date...

0,"Soundcore Life P2 Mini - A single tap away from greatness Convenience and comfort. That's what tws earbuds should embody. The P2 mini nail the comfort, but they lack the convenience by lacking volume control. Too many times I go to reach for one of my earbuds to raise or lower the volume - only to forget I can't on this pair. It frustrates me.

-

THAT said... despite this extremely obvious and avoidable deficiency, I can't help but reach for these time and time again. Mainly because they're comfortable, and they sound good. They're comfortable because they're compact and light, and they sound good because Soundcore knows what they're doing - except leaving volume controls off this earbud. 

-

Seriously, if these HAD volume control, I'd say forget anything else under $100 unless you NEED the more tech forward features and just buy these. It still boggles my mind that companies leave out one of the most basic functions of owning an earbud, but I guess product testing has deemed otherwise (I cannot fathom another reason for leaving out volume control). 

Beyond that, these are a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds, and I hope the trend of making smaller, more ergonomic designs vs packing in every feature possible becomes more viable. 

These are $20 at Best Buy in the US, and $30 on Amazon through Cyber Monday. YMMV if volume control kills it for you, but they sound good, they're comfortable, the charging case is actually good quality, and they're just fun to use. If that's all you need, I'd check these out.",soundcore life p mini single tap away greatness convenience comfort tws earbuds embody p mini nail comfort lack convenience lacking volume control many time go reach earbuds raise lower volume forget pair frustrates said despite extremely obvious avoidable deficiency help reach time time mainly comfortable sound comfortable compact light sound soundcore know except leaving volume control earbud seriously volume control say forget anything else unless need tech forward feature buy still boggles mind company leave basic function owning earbud guess product testing deemed otherwise cannot fathom another reason leaving volume control beyond fantastic pair cheap earbuds hope trend making smaller ergonomic design v packing every feature possible becomes viable best buy u amazon cyber monday ymmv volume control kill sound comfortable charging case actually quality fun need check
0,"Looking for Premium Earbuds. Longest battery life in a single charge with ANC on Hello good people, I will be updating from my awesome galaxy buds plus in the next few months. I am looking to buy a new premium pair that has the longest Battery life from a single charge with ANC enabled for working out only

money is no object, case size and additional case recharges are a bonus but not really a factor 

I listen at 40-50% volume with a maximum of 70% during really heavy attempts for hype 

Here's my list
1. Sony's WF-1000XM4 - 250$
2. Master and Dynamic MW07 PLUS - 200$
3. Jabra Elite 7 pro - 200$

Now here's where things get interesting, it's a bit of a long explanation so sorry. 

according to each company's website

the Sonys last for 8 hours with ANC (12 without).
The MW07 Plus lasts for 10 hours, and the Jabra 8 hours (no ANC rating)

Easy then, just get the XM4s right?

Well, I used reviews from 2 websites that I think are the best in earbud reviews from a thorough investigation point of view to see the quality of the ANC and battery life. 

Sound guys (they test battery life at 75 dB output volume) and Rtings (90 dB output) 

Let's get ANC quality out of the way first. 
According to sound guys, the only site that tested those 3 earbuds 
XM4 &gt; MW07 Plus &gt; Jabra (however Jabra has awesome isolation due to deep in ear fit) 

Unfortunately, the only common review between the 2 sites is the Sony XM4.

RTings should have the lower battery life since they test at a higher level. But they got ~11 hours with ANC on. Whereas Sound Guys got 7H45M as per Sony's claims..Which when compared to their reviews of the MW07 Plus (9 hours with ANC on) and Jabra Elite 7 pro (8H45M) makes me inclined to get the MW07 Plus instead of the Sony.. 

When checking both websites' galaxy buds plus reviews as a reference point for earbuds that I know how long they will last from actual usage. I saw the same thing. RTINGS lasted longer (13H30M hours vs 11H45M)

However, other reviews show expected results where RTings has the lower battery life, like the Anker Life Q35 over ear headphones 

I'm more inclined to believe the Sound Guys reviews more. However I think that their Sony review has something wrong with battery life testing, Perhaps a feature that wasn't turned off like the always on ambient awareness that recognizes if someone is talking to you and turns on ambient mode, or 3D audio, or they used the LDAC Codec

When I have the Headphones option selected I get no sound from whatever game I'm playing, nor can I use as a mic, but I can turn volume up, change sound profile etc by tapping on the earbud itself. When I use the Headset AG-Audio option I get sound from my game and can talk with my friends but I'm no longer able to control volume by tapping the earbud or change the sound profile. Which seems dumb because these boast having the Hypersync Low Latency feature but I can't even turn it on for a game......

Others say 250,- and still not that great. Often reviewers focus on one quality but never on practical use over a longer period of time.


Currently the Jabra elite 75t is 89,- for black friday. 85t's are 149,- which is an insane price jump, just as the difference between the QCY and the 75t's is insane. And even considering wired options are often great as well and so much cheaper.

0,"Earbud recommendation request I am looking for a wireless earbud recommendation.

I am coming from using Monster Achieve 100, but they got ran over by a car after the case fell out of my pocket.

It would mostly be paired with a phone, sometimes a tablet. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. 

Budget is around $100CAD, but I'm willing to reach $150CAD if the leap is warranted.

I'm looking to keep the Achieve 100's style and fit. That means I don't want the long stem style you see in products like Airpods or Anker Life P2 (I have the P2's and I don't really like them). 

Main thing I listen to are podcasts, but I also listen to music on occasion. Various rock, rap, hip hop, hell I sometimes throw pop in there if I'm feeling it. 

What I am looking for, in order of importance:

Most important would be the shape. I want it similar to the Achieve 100's as in I want the little (fin?) that holds the earbud in place. I don't want to scramble trying to grab a fallen earbud. I MIGHT be able to he swayed towards the shape of say the Soundcore Liberty 2/3 pro or galaxy buds, but I don't how much about their fit.

Just as important, I want to be able to have the option to wear ONE earbud. Specifically the left earbud. This would be in an office environment. I bought the Jabra Elite 75T after a month of research, and it turns out they only support dual earbuds or right only. No option for left. I never knew this could be an issue. I tried to work around that by turning both buds on and leaving the right ear out, but I guess the right bud is programmed to pause audio when taken out. Definitely returning the Jabras.

As a given, of course I want good sound. Doesn't have to be Bose Quietcomfort or Sony WF-1000xm4 quality, just something enjoyable.

Next, I would prefer Active Noise Cancellation or at least superb isolation. I have a roughly 40 minute commute if you combine bus and light rail. Doesn't need to be amazing, but I definitely want to notice the effect and don't want the hissing sound you can sometimes find. 

Features that would be an asset, but aren't a complete deal breaker, are:
Mobile app support (eq, settings, etc)
USB C charging (I don't necessarily need wireless charging)
Some form of water protection (IPX4+)
Pass-through sound. Sorry if I got the term wrong. I'm talking about a mode that allows you to hear your surroundings when necessary.


Call quality would be nice, but if the other features are present, I can live without amazing call quality. All I need is ""acceptable"".

So I've had the kz zsn Pro x for a while now and these are probably the best sounding earphones/headphones I've used. I've really grown to like their voice nad no matter what pair of TWS I pick they don't sound as good to me.

I tried a friends galaxy buds 2 and found them lacking.

What I'm looking for is something that sounds good. Mic quality doesn't matter as much but would be an added bonus (I don't want it to sound too bad   atleast good enough for semi quiete environments)

I've considered the FIIL T1 lite (I don't care much about features like ANC so didn't want to buy the pro) or the kz zsn Bluetooth module (the new one with Bluetooth 5.2 and apex HD support) but I've heard bad things about kz when it comes to Bluetooth like disconnects. So If anyone has this module an input would be appreciated!

My price range is about $50ish but if a TWS is under $100 and worth the price idm getting them.

0,"Help deciding between Bose QuietComfort and WF-1000XM4 Having one hell of a time deciding between these two buds.

ANC is important to me, and I'm fairly confident in both of these.  
Sony's likely will have better sound quality, but I know I'll be happy with the Bose too.  
Those are non-issue.


It really comes down to 3 main issues,

1. My ears suck. Most earbuds cause my ears to hurt within minutes. I hate it. However I own a pair of wired Bose earbuds and the Stay Hear Ultra tips are fantastic. I can wear them for hours with absolutely no pain.  
This makes me lean towards Bose. I'm afraid the XM4s will hurt.

2. The QCs have a huge ass case. For the times I'm travelling this isn't an issue, I'll have a bag with me - however if I'm just out walking around I don't bring anything with me and it looks like it wouldn't fit in my pocket comfortably, especially if I have keys/phone/etc in there.  
This makes me lean towards the XM4s.

3. This one is the least important, but still worth mentioning.
The XM4s are $349 CAD and the QCs are only $279.

  
  

Does anyone have similar ear comfort issues and have tried the XM4s?   
Were they comfortable?

Are there any other brands/models I should be looking at?",help deciding bose quietcomfort wf xm hell time deciding two bud anc important fairly confident sony likely sound quality happy bose non issue come main issue ear suck earbuds cause ear hurt within minute hate however pair wired bose earbuds stay hear ultra tip fantastic wear hour absolutely pain make lean towards bose afraid xm hurt qcs huge as case time travelling issue bag however walking around bring anything look fit pocket comfortably especially key phone etc make lean towards xm least important still worth mentioning xm cad qcs anyone similar ear comfort issue tried xm comfortable brand model

The JBL's have some impressive features: high water resistance, high battery life, good sound quality and a lot of eartips/wings.

The LG's in the other hand: UV for killing bacteria, (for what I have seen and heard) great comfort thanks to the design and medical silicone eartips, the case can be used as an audio/bluetooth transmitter, decent battery life, good enough water resistance and good sound.

The thing is, the JBL one's look the best option for me, but I'm a bit worried about the fit. I don't know if these will stay comfortably and secure in my ear when working or doing nothing, because of the big size and the weight. On the other hand, the LG one's look like a great option too, but I can't judge if I will like the sound and the fit as well.

0,"Wireless earbuds advice So, earlier today my Jabra Elite 65t case broke after 2.5 years of intensive usage. After some debating with myself and blackfriday coming up I've decided to buy a new pair of earbuds.

I've been eyeing the Sony wf-1000xm4 for a while now for their noise cancelling and form factor, but I'm unsure if they're worth the extra 100‚Ç¨ from the Jabra Elite 85t, a pair I know I'll most likely end up loving anyway due to their form factor and similarities to the 65t.

Does anyone know how much the 100‚Ç¨ price jump would be worth it for the Sony's, or perhaps someone has any other recommendations for me? I use earbuds on a daily basis in both public transport and for usage at home.

0,"Looking for earbuds when I'm training The workouts I usually do is Gym and Running.   
I have owned Jaybird X4, Jaybird Tarah Pro and I have tried working out with the Jaybird Vista.  
The Jaybird X4 didn't get a good fit at all in my ears, but When I bought the Tarah Pros I got very happily suprised because they did fit perfectly in my ears. The Jaybird Vista fits okay I guess in my ears. But when I really sweat or run for a long time they get a bit loose which is very annoying.

Now I'am looking for Truly wireless earbuds

Important features:

\-  The most imporant thing is that they fit very well in my ear like the Tarah Pro did  
\- They need to block out much sound so that I don't get annoyed in the gym  
\- The Sound should be pretty good  
\- They need to be able to connect to a training watch like the Garmin 245 Music  
\- They need to have volume controll and skip song  
\- Atleast okay battery life  


Things that don't really matter  


\- I don't mind a big case but a small one would't hurt  
\- They don't need to be good at calls

If I don't find any Truly Wireless Earbuds that fit well, Then I will buy the Tarah Pro again but I really want truly wireless ones :D

Would appreciate any form of advice :D",earbuds training workout usually gym running owned jaybird jaybird tarah pro tried working jaybird vista jaybird fit ear bought tarah pro got happily suprised fit perfectly ear jaybird vista fit okay guess ear sweat run long time bit loose annoying truly wireless earbuds important feature imporant thing fit well ear tarah pro need block much sound annoyed gym sound pretty need able connect training watch garmin music need volume controll skip song atleast okay battery life thing matter mind big case small hurt need call find truly wireless earbuds fit well buy tarah pro want truly wireless one appreciate form advice

0,"Earbuds recommendation with good mic for call &amp; ANC Hi everyone! May I ask for recommendation or advice on a good pair of earbuds with (1) good mic that can reduce background noises, &amp; (2) ANC - although this is not the main priority.

My neighbors are having constructions which has been affecting my working environment at home. I'm still okay with the noise, since I got help with my current earbuds (Sony WI-C300 &amp; JBL Endurance Run). Unfortunately, they don't bode well for online meetings as the construction noises would disrupt my call input. Although I can hear the other meeting attendees well, they might not or ended up just hearing the construction noises.

Thus, may I ask for recommendation on a pair of earbuds (&lt; US$200) which could help with reducing background noises in the mic? It'll be great if it has a noise cancelling feature too.

0,"Any sub 100 USD earbuds that can deliver similar sound quality to Sennheiser 350bt headphones? Hi all,

I tried posting this question over at r/headphones, but it got removed so I'm hoping to find some answers here instead.

I'm not an audiophile and I'm more than happy with my Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, but they are not ideal for running in, so I'm looking to buy some earbuds that sound just as good but for around 80 USD max. They do not need to be noise cancelling, have super long battery life, etc.  Just as long as they are BT earbuds and not have any cords.

Anyone here with personal experience / expertise in the matter?

0,"Had to get rid of my Galaxy Buds Pro due to allergic reaction, what are my best alternatives? So after dealing with months of unexplained ear infections it was determined my beloved Galaxy Buds Pro were the cause.  I am currently trying out both the Jabra Elite 85T and Anker Liberty Pro 3's but so far neither are meeting my needs as much as the Galaxy Buds Pro did.

For reference my hearing is subpar so audio quality is less important as fit, good ANC, good transparency mode, and a good mic for call. Multipoint is also important as I am constantly going back and forth between my Samsung phone and tablet.  Wireless charging is ideal but if I had to give it up to get everything else I could live without it.

Based on those requirements I slightly prefer the 85t's as at least for my ears the fit is more secure and transparency mode is better (although still not as good as the Galaxy Buds). ANC seems about the same no both but the mic is much better on the Liberty's plus it handles wind noise much better than the 85t's (although again not as well as the Galaxy Buds)

I also feel like the Liberty's are a bit unpolished with the current firmware. I have lots of issues where I will take them out of the case, put them in my ears and only one bud will work which requires me to fiddle with it to get it to activate. I also hate the amount of gymnastics it takes to get them in and out of the case correctly.

Are there any other buds based on what I am looking for that I should consider?  I have heard the newer Jabra Elite 7 Pro's have a better mic than the 85t's but I am also hearing the current firmware is buggy with poor ANC and no Multipoint yet.

0,"Looking for ANC buds with specific requirements for live band Hey folks, i thought maybe i might have some luck posting to this community after coming up short elsewhere. 

Im a musician singing in a medium loud two piece band (guitar and drums). My hearing has been damaged over the years playing full time in more than medium loud bands and as a result im desperately trying to cling on to what hearing i have left. 

Ive used all sorts of ear plugs over the years including custom molds, and ofc they all suffer the problem of giving you the boomy headvoice that ruins your experience as a vocalist. 

Finally i started using Bose QC 25s to jam and wow they are perfect. The eq profile they attenuate removes all the low mid mud and leaves softened but clear mids and highs, without any headvoice, so i can monitor my mic control and hear the room as if i werent wearing hearing protection. They occasionally clip but not enough to be a big deal. Im hoping 7 or so years of ANC tech has made things better in this regard. 

So unfortunately although they are perfect in the auditory sense, the look of wearing headphones on stage is a deal breaker. Im hoping that there are some earbuds (preferably cheap) that have exceptionally strong ANC and that are ported like the airpod pros to eliminate the headvoice. Sound quality literally doesnt matter, i will only be using them as battery powered earplugs. Bonus points if theyre wired, as i could then use them as IEMs. I hate the foam tips on my IEMs and cant ever get them into my ear canals, i need a small silicon tip which defeats the purpose unfortunately.

0,"Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Ramblings  Pros 

* Sounds is good, great clarity and bass, bit piercing high end
* Good ANC
* Firmware updates shows improvement commitment 
* Good mic

Cons 

* ANC feels dirty in loud environment
* Puttings buds back in case is difficult 

Soundcore liberty 3 pro (Firmware 4.58, L3P) is a great earbud but comes with some serious downfalls for me. The earbuds have a sleek case that is pocketable, good for carrying around. However to wear the buds, you need to rotate the buds 180\* degree before putting into your ear, this is still ok as you can get the hang of it. Putting back the earbuds is a different story, its feel really unintuitive to take your earbuds out, rotate it 180\* then put it back. Not really suitable for storing earbuds on the go and storing these becomes a really deliberate action. 

The sound quality is pretty good with the earbuds. I have a bad ear for identity sound quality and will try my best here. Vocal and bass is good, bass is really heavy and clear, vocal clarity is clear for wireless earbuds. However, high ends sometimes feel sharp and piercing, which could be fixed with custom EQ. 

HearID ANC works in L3P. Using Android‚Äôs soundcore app for HearID, it requires the mic access only when HearID is running. I think that it's using the phone app alongside the earbuds to do some tuning for the ANC. The ANC works well in a normal environment, better than AirPods Pro in some situations. In a loud environment the ANC is able to tune down the noise, but at the same time it feels like it's casting a layer of thin white noise for the ANC to work. This approach just makes the ANC feel dirty when it's used in a loud environment like during my bus commute. 

Earbuds have been used for 3 days and already received 2 updates, one out of box, and a recent one that fixed the previously lousy mic. Regardless, I will put this for sale, it's a great buds but the difficult storing and the dirty ANC make it not suitable for my commute purpose.

Ok so I bought new earbuds since the soundcore liberty air 2 pros I bought the last time hurt my ears and didn't wanna fit well, tested these edifiers for half an hour and couldn't tell if they're better, they seemed more comfortable, and they prolly are, but wearing them half an hour already brings my ears fatigue ü•≤ü•≤ idk I guess it's the airpods form that I don't like (with this stem), before that I only had round earbuds like Xiaomi airdots and they were pretty comfortable for my ears but well.. 

-- SOUND 
so when I tried these earbuds the first thing I noticed right away was that the sound quality was not that much different than the soundcores, dynamic mode was on by default but to me it sounded kinda artificial so I put them on classic mode and now they sound almost exactly like liberty air 2 pro (to my ears). And this is good sound quality, everything is balanced I literally get goose bumps, even bass is fine (although I don't really like too much bass, so the songs I listen to are usually acoustic) they do mix stuff when there's too much going on in the song but I guess that's ok

-- APP
But what makes them different from the soundcore earbuds is this absurdly stupid app. First of all it keeps asking for the permission to work on top of apps - I have no idea why. Secondly it has this stupid panel in the notifications panel (I personally hate to have anything permanent in my notifications panel) and they don't provide any setting to turn it offü•≤ so I had to disable it via android os tools. The app itself looks like they made it yesterday in a hurryü•≤ u can see I'm not lying if you check its rating on Google play store üòÖ it's really such a contrast when u first get the earbuds and their packaging is pretty good, they even include a bag for the case, but then u download the app and now u look like u just bought a pair of 3$ earbuds but paid 100+$ for them ahah 

-- ANC
honestly anc on these earbuds seems a bit stronger than on the soundcores, the soundcores they kinda have this hiss and u wonder what's the point of replacing the ambient noise with this hiss the earbuds themselves produce))) with these there's also a bit of noise present but they're still a bit better I think.

So in the end I wasn't really impressed by these earbuds and I'm not even an audiophile who's pampered by awesome expensive earbuds, these are only second earbuds that I'm buying within the same budget.. what turned me off was the app firstly, secondly I expected a lot better quality than from the soundcore liberty air 2 pros but nope, also these stupid voice lines every time you change a mode are so annoying, and there's no way to turn them off üòÖ 
Would I personally recommend them to anyone? No way. Their sound quality is ok but the user interface is laughable, they act like cheap earbuds from Ali, like those counterfeit earpods you can buy lol but that's only my take on it, someone more experienced like El Jefe would prolly have a more educated opinion on this üòå",edifier neobuds pro sound quality laughably bad app preface ok bought earbuds since soundcore liberty air pro bought last time hurt ear wanna fit well tested edifiers half hour tell seemed comfortable prolly wearing half hour already brings ear fatigue idk guess airpods form stem round earbuds xiaomi airdots pretty comfortable ear well sound tried earbuds first thing noticed right away sound quality much different soundcores dynamic mode default sounded kinda artificial put classic mode sound almost exactly liberty air pro ear sound quality everything balanced literally goose bump even bass fine although much bass song listen usually acoustic mix stuff much going song guess ok app make different soundcore earbuds absurdly stupid app first keep asking permission work top apps idea secondly stupid panel notification panel personally hate anything permanent notification panel provide setting turn disable via android o tool app look made yesterday hurry u see lying check rating google play store contrast u first earbuds packaging pretty even include bag case u download app u look u bought pair earbuds paid ahah anc honestly anc earbuds seems bit stronger soundcores soundcores kinda hiss u wonder point replacing ambient noise hiss earbuds produce bit noise present still bit think end impressed earbuds even audiophile pampered awesome expensive earbuds second earbuds buying within budget turned app firstly secondly expected lot quality soundcore liberty air pro nope stupid voice line every time change mode annoying way turn personally recommend anyone way sound quality ok user interface laughable act cheap earbuds ali counterfeit earpods buy lol take someone experienced el jefe prolly educated opinion

0,"Stem design or earbud? Best option for 60 dollar bracket I'm torn between making a choice between stem styled or bud styled tws. Having surfed the internet for quite some days now made me even more confused.
Personally I'm biased towards stem styled tws in that they look like you mean business and could work even in formal settings unlike the bud styled ones which are rather sporty.

I have my eyes on a number of tws in each price bracket but haven't been able to commit to one. Initially it was about just having a pair in 30ish dollar but delving into the market and the variety of products made me push my budget and search for the best bang for the buck . 
Here is my carefully crafted tentative list in each price category :

30$ ish : FIL t lite , edifier tws 1 pro ,

40$ ish : sound peats te3 se, sound peats sonic 

50-60$ ish : ear fun free pro, FIL t1 pro , sound peats h1, flybuds c1, sound core life p3

Even willing to explore the 70$ ish bracket if it offers a more comprehensive product.

My major dilemma with this is that I I want everything in the product that I lay my hands on to. Comfortable and secure fit(not too bulky), good battery life, low latency, pocketable case, preferably an app support,clear mics and a balanced sound signature with emphasis on mids and vocals and a bass that hits deep with a thump and rumble but at no point becomes too bassy or muddy or too piercing and has enough air to it and proper instrument separation. 

Suggestions and arguments would be welcome on this thread.

0,"Need a replacement for my EPH-100SL So after many years, one of my EPH-100SL ears is starting to fail. I had a spare, but I gave it away to a friend. Thankfully, it isn't completely dead yet, so I can still live by tweaking the balance. I can't seem to find a new pair of EPH-100SLs to ship here timely (Canada). I do have a newegg pair that might get here, but it'll take a month.

Do you guys have a cheaper recommendation that might tide me over, in case this pair dies completely? I'd also like it as a backup. I'm not an audiophile, but I do prefer the sound profile I get from these earphones from many other similarly priced options I tried years ago. I'd describe those other options as crisp and engaging, but more 'offensive' than my trusty EPH-100SL, which were suitable for listening given any mood or circumstance, if that describes my taste in any way.",need replacement eph sl many year eph sl ear starting fail spare gave away friend thankfully completely dead yet still live tweaking balance seem find pair eph sl ship timely canada newegg pair might take month guy cheaper recommendation might tide case pair dy completely backup audiophile prefer sound profile earphone many similarly priced option tried year ago describe option crisp engaging offensive trusty eph sl suitable listening given mood circumstance describes taste way

I wasn¬¥t using my soundpeats Sonic earbuds for around two months. Now it seems that the charging case does not do anything. No LED light, no reaction to USB connection or bud insertion.

I always manually switch off the earbuds so the buds itself are working fine and are fully loaded, but it seems the charging case discharged itself during this time completely to a point where the internal li-io battery is just dead ( I know that if the voltage of those batteries falls below a certain point they are dead and cannot be recharged...). 

So what now? Is this a warranty issue or ""my own fault""?

0,"Every truly wireless pair I‚Äôve tried just sounds worse I‚Äôve been using pretty cheap pairs of wireless headphones that are connected by a wire, such as the Otium Wireless IPX7. They serve me fine, but I‚Äôve been trying to make a switch to truly wireless headphones for a while. For a variety of reasons, but not having my headphones tangle up with my mask when I want to take one or the other off would free me of most burdens in life. 

The problem is, and this is driving me crazy, every pair I‚Äôve tried just sounds terrible in my ears. The sound comes through muffled, it‚Äôs clearly harder to distinguish different instruments in music, and the volume never seems to get nearly as loud as my ‚Äúwireless but with a wire‚Äù earbuds.

For context I‚Äôve most recently tried the Earfun Free 2 and Jabra Elite 75t, as well as 1-2 a while ago that I can‚Äôt remember. Now based on the reviews for these pairs and everyone else‚Äôs experience, it‚Äôs obvious my $20 earbuds don‚Äôt just magically deliver better sound quality, but something must be going on because the difference is quite stark to me (and not in a positive way).

My main suspicion is that my ear geometry is just not compatible with these earbuds for some reason. The truly wireless earbuds I‚Äôve tried all sit in my ear in a specific way that other earbuds don‚Äôt. They feel like they‚Äôre lodged in place and sitting deeper in my ear. 

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything through Google, so I wanted to check if anyone in this community has had a similar experience and/or can recommend a pair of truly wireless headphones that may fit differently.",every truly wireless pair tried sound worse using pretty cheap pair wireless headphone connected wire otium wireless ipx serve fine trying make switch truly wireless headphone variety reason headphone tangle mask want take free burden life problem driving crazy every pair tried sound terrible ear sound come muffled clearly harder distinguish different instrument music volume never seems nearly loud wireless wire earbuds context recently tried earfun free jabra elite well ago remember based review pair everyone else experience obvious earbuds magically deliver sound quality something must going difference quite stark positive way main suspicion ear geometry compatible earbuds reason truly wireless earbuds tried sit ear specific way earbuds feel lodged place sitting deeper ear anyway able find anything google wanted check anyone community similar experience recommend pair truly wireless headphone may fit differently

0,"My Terrible Experience with Mifo Audio (Canada) Preface, I have literally never returned anything I have bough online, even clothes I have bought that don't fit or I didn't like, I just stomached the loss usually due the high cost of shipping it back (also a bit lazy). This was my first time returning/warrantying anything, and it was a horrible experience.

TLDR: Order earbuds on August 27, 2021 with express 2-day shipping for an extra $23.50, received broken earbuds 6 days later. Dealt with horrible, insulting, and  slow customer service that finally accepted my warranty on September 20th that I had to pay an extra $20 to ship back. Finally received my ear buds 74 days after purchase on November 9th.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to buy a pair of Mifo O5 plus from [mifoaudio.ca](https://mifoaudio.ca), after doing research on several pairs. My decision was made due to their high battery life in the case, as well as good customer service reviews. 

My order was placed on August 27th, and I paid an extra $23.50 for express 2-day shipping since I was heading on a back country hike on September 1st, and bought these for that specific hike. It arrived on September 3rd, 6 days after the purchase date. I wasn't too upset at this as I requested a refund on the express shipping which was finally approved after several frustrating emails back and forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this was the end of it, I would still have left a 4/5 star review. However, the left earbud never even turned on. The instant I took it out of the box, the left earbud never had any power, never played a single second of music, and never charged. Of course, I charged the earbud case, I ensured the earbud was in contact with the charging lead, and nothing happened after a couple hours of charging.  

I instantly sent Mifo an email about this, which I was sent a response with steps on ensuring the earbud is properly charging, to clean the contact leads, to reset the earbud, to ensure Bluetooth connection, etc. I followed all the steps, and ensured the customer service agent it was an issue with the earbud never even turning on, but it seemed like the agent never even read my response, and listed a second list of actions I could take to reset the earbud. It was almost a direct copy of the first instructions, just more in depth, assuming I didn't understand the first email. I sent back a VIDEO, of me conducting those exact steps to reset, or charge the earbuds, proving that the earbud will not charge. 

For a 3rd time, they responded with a final list of instructions, again repeating the exact steps I have just performed on video. Clearly they did not read my last email, and even actually wrote the instructions in more depth as if I do not understand how to use electronics or read instructions. Also, these instructions were all on how to reset or properly charge the earbud, which I have no said over 3 times that it was not the issue. It also took multiple days for some responses and this part of my warranty was dragged on for over a week just to be exactly where I started. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, over 10 emails back and forth, they ""approved"" my warranty, and all I had to do was pay for tracked shipping and return it back to their warehouse. I asked if I could be reimbursed for this shipping, and was sent a snarky return stating how because they would be paying for the default shipping of the new pair back to me (default shipping is free for the customer on any earbud purchase keep in mind), and that they were doing me a favour by warrantying the earbuds FOR ME? I never broke the earbuds, I never used them, and they made it seem like a huge favour that they would be replacing them for me.  To avoid taking a &gt;$100 dollar loss now, I paid $20 for shipping and returned the pair back to them on September 20th. 

Now, the biggest insult out of this exchange, I only just finally received the earbuds today on November 9th.... over a month after shipping my pair back. I inquired about the process on my warranty on October 15th, and was sent a response that they have processed the warranty and they are just waiting on a tracking number from their dispatch team. I received my tracking information  over 2 weeks later on November 3rd. Not only did I pay $20 extra, than any other Mifo 05 plus customer, I received them 74 days after the date of purchase. I have not done any testing on if this earbud was worth the money, but nothing will be worth that 74 day wait, with the additional insult from the customer service experience. 

Throughout my conversation with them, I stated multiple times how displeased I was, even apologizing when I got frustrated with their copy and paste responses, and got nothing but scripted responses and no reimbursement besides the express shipping costs. I hope none of you ever had to deal with this warranty process and this has been my worst shopping experience ever.",terrible experience mifo audio canada preface literally never returned anything bough online even clothes bought fit stomached loss usually due high cost shipping back bit lazy first time returning warrantying anything horrible experience tldr order earbuds august express day shipping extra received broken earbuds day later dealt horrible insulting slow customer service finally accepted warranty september th pay extra ship back finally received ear bud day purchase november th b chose buy pair mifo plus mifoaudio ca mifoaudio ca research several pair decision made due high battery life case well customer service review order placed august th paid extra express day shipping since heading back country hike september st bought specific hike arrived september rd day purchase date upset requested refund express shipping finally approved several frustrating email back forth b end still left star review however left earbud never even turned instant took box left earbud never power never played single second music never charged course charged earbud case ensured earbud contact charging lead nothing happened couple hour charging instantly sent mifo email sent response step ensuring earbud properly charging clean contact lead reset earbud ensure bluetooth connection etc followed step ensured customer service agent issue earbud never even turning seemed agent never even read response listed second list action could take reset earbud almost direct copy first instruction depth assuming understand first email sent back video conducting exact step reset charge earbuds proving earbud charge rd time responded final list instruction repeating exact step performed video clearly read last email even actually wrote instruction depth understand electronics read instruction instruction reset properly charge earbud said time issue took multiple day response part warranty dragged week exactly started b finally email back forth approved warranty pay tracked shipping return back warehouse asked could reimbursed shipping sent snarky return stating paying default shipping pair back default shipping free customer earbud purchase keep mind favour warrantying earbuds never broke earbuds never used made seem huge favour replacing avoid taking dollar loss paid shipping returned pair back september th biggest insult exchange finally received earbuds today november th month shipping pair back inquired process warranty october th sent response processed warranty waiting tracking number dispatch team received tracking information week later november rd pay extra mifo plus customer received day date purchase done testing earbud worth money nothing worth day wait additional insult customer service experience throughout conversation stated multiple time displeased even apologizing got frustrated copy paste response got nothing scripted response reimbursement besides express shipping cost hope none ever deal warranty process worst shopping experience ever

0,"Earbuds I can sleep with Hello

Since I moved from the countryside to a big city I've had trouble getting quality sleep.

I think that has to do with traffic and overall noise of people in bars and in the streets since my appartment is up a narrow street and noice reverbates.

Earplugs are hit or miss, most of the time they just fall or don't fit properly. And having to change them regularly is a pain.

I have cheap earbuds already, Xiaomi's AirDots I bought for 15‚Ç¨ a little over a year ago and I'm very pleased with them. Surprisingly okay for the price.

But I think I want to upgrade to something better, and also to something that can help me sleep better if it exists.

What are your recommendations for this kind of use ?

I don't think I can go over 150‚Ç¨, but depending on the product I might go over.

Thanks ! :)",earbuds sleep hello since moved countryside big city trouble getting quality sleep think traffic overall noise people bar street since appartment narrow street noice reverbates earplug hit miss time fall fit properly change regularly pain cheap earbuds already xiaomi airdots bought little year ago pleased surprisingly okay price think want upgrade something something help sleep exists recommendation kind think go depending product might go thanks

0,"Best call quality earbuds 2021 I spent the last few hours on call with a friend trying to find her a pair of good call quality earbuds, and unintentionally ended up with a semi-comprehensive list. Keep in mind, though, this is based on my opinion and hers alone, and the website used for the audio was [rtings.com](https://rtings.com). Only no disturbance sounds tests were used as that was her use case. 

**Cost-effective - Tozo T6:** anything cheaper than this was just too poor to consider. These sounded audibly worse than the best below, but were also much better than a lot of more expensive buds.

**Flat out Best - Galaxy Buds 2:** of the about 50 to 75 earbuds we went through, the buds 2 were the fullest sounding, best overall call quality earbuds in a quiet environment.

General brand trends noticed: Apple and Bose didn't stand a chance. Both were substantially worse than the buds 2. Sony and JBL sounded hollow and were worse than the buds 2, but still better than the previous 2 brands. Lastly, Jabra was the closest second brand to Samsung, but the buds pro and buds 2 were just better with calls and overall quality.

Hopefully this helps!

1,"I listened to a Topping stack and now I don't know what I believe anymore.. My little brother recently decided to bite the bullet and upgrade his Ifi hip-dac to a Topping d10/l30 stack.

 I've been reading a lot and the internet had me convinced that all amps sound the same if not pushed to their limits, and differences between modern dacs are indiscernible and anyone claiming otherwise has golden ears. 

This belief of mine was strengthened when I A/B tested his hip dac and my Ifi Zen stack and neither of us could hear a difference unless we cranked the volume up to distortion levels 

Thus I was surprised when he said after it arrived that ""The topping stack had better soundstage"". 

Today I had a chance to listen to his stack and I started with a healthy dose of scepticism, because two stacks in the same price range should have have only subtle differences, if any.

I was immediately blown away.. it was night and day. The topping stack was wide, clean and detailed. The zen stack was narrow, congested and compressed but warm in comparison. I couldn't believe how apparent it was. 

We tested a few different headphones and the most striking case was the Meze 99 neos. They are by nature headphones with narrow soundstage and muddy midrange. 

On the ifi stack they were exactly this and unsatisfying to listen to. The topping stack compensated for the above beautifully and they were actually a pleasure.

We carefully level matched and did blind testing too, and my entire family could hear the difference.

 I'm not sure what happened here, do only good stacks sound alike and are budget ifi products just bad? Is Sinad more important than I thought?

 Anybody with thought or similar experiences wants to weigh in?

1,"Safe levels approximation / reference without measuring tools Hi guys, been researching on safe levels of listening and that got me thinking what levels do I approximately listen to. Doesn't have to be perfect but an approximate. I think we can calculate that by knowing the sensitivity, impedance of the headphone and power output of the dac/amp but I am not sure. Some calculators online give how much power is needed to power a headphone by giving headphone impedance and sensitivity as input but when searching e10k which I am using there isn't a chart that shows how much voltage e10k outputs at all levels of volume Knob.

Basically I am confused how to go about this. I am using 900 pro x and e10k and I want to know what is approximately 85db of sound through it.

Is there any easier to understand calculation that we can do? Is or are there any everyday sounds which we can produce and compare to side by side for an approximation?

At first I thought this was because my iPad Pro can push more power, however, power draw shouldn‚Äôt be an issue since the DH80S is battery powered, thus it does not need to rely on the power from the iPhone or iPad. So since the DH80S is using the power from its built in battery there shouldn‚Äôt be any differences due to difference in power draw right? But there is, and by a lot.

1,"Five things I don't like about the Hifiman Ananda, and why I'm going to keep it anyway One year ago I bought my first open-back headphones, a Sennheiser HD560S. They brought new life and depth to my music, but unfortunately I get tired of listening to them easily. I am fairly treble-sensitive and they have a bit of a treble spike.

The Ananda came with high praise as a timeless headphone from all sources. When I saw a good deal on them, I pulled the trigger a little too quickly. As I continued to browse reviews while they were in the mail I started to doubt my decision, as some of the things I talk about below were briefly mentioned.

Now that it's here and I've had a chance to examine it, there are a lot of things I don't like about the Ananda, in ascending order of annoyance:

1. It has a dip in its subbass frequencies. This is much less noticeable than I expected and it barely bothers me.
2. The included cables are a weird mixed bag of quality. The connectors to the headphones look good enough. The connector at the device end is excellent, made fully of metal and able to rotate freely while the plug stays still in the outlet. But the cable itself is coated in a ribbed, translucent rubber that reminds me of kelp or bamboo. You can see the copper inside through it, and you can feel the innards shifting around when you pinch it.
3. Vocals are significantly recessed. Not a big deal, I can get used to it, but I prefer a balanced signature. Subjectively, I find that male vocals sound better than female vocals. Kanye West's ""Jail"" had a sublimely clear and airy feel that recreated my first awestruck experiences with hi-fi audio.
4. Comfort compared to the 560S is a downgrade. The earpads are pure luxury but at some angles it starts to hurt my head.
5. They have a pronounced sibilant treble spike even worse than the 560S. The first song I listen to with a new pair of headphones is always ""Compass"" by Lady A. When I heard the ""s"" in the first line ""Yeah it'**s** been a bumpy road"", I winced and almost ripped them off and returned them right then. In the chorus, even some of Hillary Scott's vowels verged into sibilance.

Why am I going to keep them in spite of all this? Because holy cow, their soundstage and detail retrieval are insane. I heard new details in songs I'd listened to a dozen times with my 560S. If I pass my hand two inches from the edge of the headphone, I can hear the sound quality drop; it is that wide.

In summary: I personally shouldn't have bought these headphones. But I think other people would enjoy them. I don't like to buy new cables, but maybe you're OK with that. I might get headaches from the strap, but I'm bald and a person with hair to cushion the strap might not have that problem. Maybe you like your headphone to have recessed vocals and/or a treble spike. As with many things in audio, it's all subjective.",five thing hifiman ananda going keep anyway year ago bought first open back headphone sennheiser hd brought life depth music unfortunately tired listening easily fairly treble sensitive bit treble spike ananda came high praise timeless headphone source saw deal pulled trigger little quickly continued browse review mail started doubt decision thing talk briefly mentioned chance examine lot thing ananda ascending order annoyance dip subbass frequency much le noticeable expected barely bother included cable weird mixed bag quality connector headphone look enough connector device end excellent made fully metal able rotate freely plug stay still outlet cable coated ribbed translucent rubber reminds kelp bamboo see copper inside feel innards shifting around pinch vocal significantly recessed big deal used prefer balanced signature subjectively find male vocal sound female vocal kanye west jail sublimely clear airy feel recreated first awestruck experience hi fi audio comfort compared downgrade earpads pure luxury angle start hurt head pronounced sibilant treble spike even worse first song listen pair headphone always compass lady heard first line yeah bumpy road winced almost ripped returned right chorus even hillary scott vowel verged sibilance going keep spite holy cow soundstage detail retrieval insane heard detail song listened dozen time pas hand two inch edge headphone hear sound quality drop wide summary personally bought headphone think people enjoy buy cable maybe ok might headache strap bald person hair cushion strap might problem maybe headphone recessed vocal treble spike many thing audio subjective

1,"Recommendations for a smaller case/bag for DT 1770? I recently bought a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pros, mostly for listening to music both at home and on the go. The latter obviously requires me to take them places, and while the included hardcase is awesome, it isn't exactly backpack-friendly. Since the smaller Beyerdynamic hardcase has the same measurements at its largest points in each dimension, I don't think it would solve the problem, especially in terms of thickness.

As someone who doesn't know all that much about headphones and headphone accessories, I haven't been able to find anything slimmer that fits the DT 1770 Pro yet.    
Is there maybe anything out there that shaves off another two centimeters?

Recently I bought the akg k371, but when used with the Fiio M9, I found the sound a little far, maybe a bigger soundstage. When using the Cayin N3, it sounds louder, more in my face, good for garage rock, etc. It sounds more fun.

Also, i tend to turn off the Fiio M9, so it takes a little more for it to get back on compared to the Cayin n3, the cayin n3 feels a little better on my hand and lighter too.

1,"My impressions of various ¬£50~200 headphones: MDR-10RC, X2HR, DT770, Roland RH-A-30, HD598 + others. Sorry if this appears to be an aimless post with zero point, but I thought I'd just give my long term impressions of various headphones that I've used throughout the many years I've been into audio listening and production. All of them are around the ¬£50-200 range so nothing here is earth shattering in price, and the main reason why I've yet to really spend a lot on ""the one"" for me is simply because I just don't really know exactly what I want yet. I've switched between liking headphones and wanting to get rid of them in a space of a day because a quirk or ""issue"" props up during work or listening.


**Sony MDR-10RC**

One of the first headphones I used a lot was actually the Sony MDR-10RC headphones, mainly because I was able to grab them for super cheap a couple years back when I was a broke student - like ¬£25 new. They're on-ear and were really easy to carry around, and the sound was surprisingly good. Yeah, it has that overly inflated bass response, and since the design of the headphones couldn't create a great seal around my ears it mostly just meant that it all felt really mushed together, it wasn't very punchy or deep. The treble and low mid range had some dips creating a bit of a darker sound in a few tracks (and especially noticable on waveforms and synths), but hey! For the price I paid I really cannot complain at all - they were put through hell for years and have basically evaporated at this point - it's really loose fitting and the earcups are beyond destroyed. Also, replacement earpads will cost me as much as what I paid for the entire thing!

**Audio Technica M50x**

I got these as a recommendation from a friend from university, I demo'd his pair with a quick track that was on my workstation at the time and they sounded like enhanced versions of the MDR-10RC, so I got them as I was already used to the bassy sound but now the extra treble made things sound more sparkly - cool!

When I got my pair and demo'd a lot more of the tracks I typically listen to, I did enjoy that the treble was far more pronounced but I didn't like the bass or mids as much as I thought I would. It's a similar problem to the 10RC, but with an even more closed in and intense sound (due to the pads and grip?), and the biggest issue of them all likely because of that - they were so painful. My ears wanted to fall off after an hour of using them.

I paid more than 4x the price compared to my MDR-10RC and I found myself not wanting to use them due to the lack of comfort so in the end I just decided to return them. I don't think they were exactly bad sounding at all and they do sound better than the 10RC - it was mostly the comfort that ruined it for me.

**Beyer DT770 80ohm**

These headphones are interesting. I got them shortly after the M50x and my honest first impressions was that I didn't like the bass after being used to the 10RC/M50. Also, everything sounded quite harsh and sibilant (especially on flutes and voice), but I decided that I'm absolutely sticking with these as they were incredibly comfortable and they didn't have that fatiguing boomy, closed in sound that made a lot of songs a bit uncomfortable to listen to - especially if the producers decide to crank the bass way too much already in the mix!

What's really funny is that within a week of using them all of a sudden the bass felt way stronger - too strong! - it was actually offputting and made me look into EQ software for my interface to get back to what I was used to.

I ""balanced"" it to reduce the sibilance and lower the bass to make it more flat sounding and stuck with that for months and gradually enjoyed the sound far more and more until I couldn't have it any other way, at least... I thought I did, until I realized that for the last couple weeks the bloody EQ program wasn't even working as I plugged the interface in another USB port at some point. It was then I realized that I just need to get used to things more as opposed to messing with them for weeks on end - in all, the DT770's sound great. They definitely can be sibilant but I don't mind that at all, and I'd say that the bass is slightly emphasized and the mids are good but certainly not aggressive. I actually still have these to this day.

**Sennheiser HD598**

My first open headphones. To cut straight to the point, I liked them a lot except for that emphasized high-bass that made a lot of low frequency instruments sound strangely resonsant. It threw me off a lot when working with audio and some songs that had an emphasis on punchy, mid-forward bass sounded like they were playing in a small, reflective room. At first I thought it was just revealing a bad mix but I had that ""damn it"" moment when taking a few projects into a studio with a good monitoring system - what sounded punchy just sounded boxy on the headphones, and balancing sound with the HD598 made me reduce the low mids too much to compensate, it was a frustrating thing. I liked everything else about it but that one problem kept bothering me too much that I sold them and went back to the DT770.

Shame, because the sound stage? Nice! Comfort? Excellent! And it had detachable cables!


**Roland RH-300**

I got these cheap and I'm a bit of a Roland hardware mark so I couldn't resist. Anyway, you can have a look at them and realize they're basically just Audio Technica M50's but with a few different things here and there, and it does change the sound quite considerably. Compared to the M50x I'd say that the RH-300 has less boomy bass but far more recessed treble and more forward mids, so you pretty much just get a flatter, darker sounding version of the M50. Are they bad? Nope, I actually enjoy the sound! They work wonders with a few tracks, especially a lot of indie rock where you want that close, in-your-face punchy sound. However, I can't use them much because just like the M50x, they make me ears want to fall off and run away after about an hour of use. I've bought some replacement pads of different materials but it just makes them sound worse.

**Philips Fidelio X2HR**

To prevent me from turning into a closed-back-only club after selling my HD598, I got these.  I like them... I think. I'm actually not too sure anymore and I don't even know how to explain it properly. It's almost as though you're listening to music from a couple steps away from a speaker than you're expected to? All of the sound is there, there's nothing obviously wrong or harshly imbalanced, but it's almost as though you're hearing some kind of distant, reflective resonance at all times that makes a lot of the sound bleed into each other that messes with the attack and presence of a lot of instruments in a song. It's *really* nitpicky, I know, and what I'm talking about is not noticable unless you compare it with other sound sources. The build quality is great, the comfort is fantastic and I think they look really cool.

I'm not entirely sure what to think of them at the moment, or if I'll keep using them. I gave them multiple weeks and... I'm still unsure.

**Roland RH-A30**

Again, they look like they were based off the M50's, but these ones are open-backs and built a little nicer than the RH-300. Hey, you ask, why would you buy this when they destroy your ears? Well, this one is slightly bigger and actually has these nice, fat velour pads! They don't ruin my ears!

I've only had these for a few weeks now and if I was to describe the sound I'd say it's not as distant or blurry as the X2HR, it has more treble than the RH-300 but it isn't piercing, it's not as bassy or sibilant as the DT770 but if there's one thing that's clear, it's that the mids are very forward and can be quite aggressive. They make my X2HR's sound mid-scooped. It seems to be mostly flat with a very slight push in the low mids and 10k range. It makes snare drums, electric guitars, vocals and flutes stand out a lot. The soundstage isn't as distant as the HD598 but it isn't closed in either. Build quality is not as good at the X2HR, they make creaky noises if you move a lot, and it has no detachable cable which sucks, but I took a chance on these and I'm pretty surprised at how much I'm enjoying them, which also makes me realize that I'm someone that seems to prefer more mids and treble compared to bass in their headphones, which was quite a reversal from when my journal started.

I don't know if anyone read all of that, but I hope my rambling brought any kind of interest to you if I did take up your time. Just for a bonus, I'll post my uh, taste in songs that I demo headphones with. At least, the ones that I can even find online!


[Sword of Justice - Beyond the Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsJtKXsQTf8)

Metal warning - loud! Super aggressive mid-focused guitars, punchy lows, bright female vocals and sharp synths/harpsichords. This song can easily sound wrong if you have headphones that boost bass, scoop the mids or mess with the treble too much. The X2HR brings out the sub bass too much, makes the harpsichord sound blurred and takes the vocals back a little, the DT770 sounds great and is the least fatiguing to listen to and the while the RH-A30 sounds very balanced, the forward mids can make the song sound very aggressive.

[Chirinuruwowaka - Milk-iro no Touge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjPTGNNgFYA)

Very sharp sounding mids on this song and a lot of frequencies in that ""boxy"" bass range due to the bass tone and percussion. Some headphones that dial back the mids make the vocals and guitars sound mushed together since they're mixed so close. The HD598 made the drums and bass sound way too resonant and boxy. The DT770 and RH-A30 sound best.

[Unmei wa Utsukushiku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_LOcDbkf8)

What?! Okay, depending on the headphones, if they lack detail in the low mids or have rollercoaster treble, it can make the vocals feel like they're vieled back and too bright while the other instruments just overtake her. The song sounds badly balanced on the X2HR, a bit too thin on the DT770 but sounds pretty good on the HD598 and RH-A30.

[Ken Nagakawa - A Rusted Neigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0BgHEOruek)

It's a very percussive song with a deep bass, lots of atmospheric pads and a flute lead. The X2HR brings out the bass but it actually sounds quite nice at first as it doesn't take much away from the lead... the only problem is after the 1:00 mark, it just sounds a little too V shaped as it's emphasizing the thumping bass and leads too much. The DT770 and RH-A30 sound completely fine here.

So I just bought myself a pair of X2hr headphones and I really like them.  Unfortunately they don't sound great when I use them with my Samsung S10+.  Using the headphone jack they just sound fine.  Much better when I plug them into the headphone output of my reciever.  I don't have a dedicated headphone amp.  I don't have a dedicated DAC.  I'm on a budget and I want something that will make listening on my phone a better experience.

So I looked at a number of DAC amp combos and man, there is just way to much out there. Not to mention usually to expensive.  I want something portable, and under 50 bucks.

I have heard good things about the sound quality from the apple USB c dongle but I have also heard it doesn't work great with Android. But it's very cheap and extremely portable.  Any one able to share there experience with it?

Are there any other dongle type DAC amps that are of good quality that work well with Android? Again under about 50.  Small budget I know but it's what I can afford right now.

Or would I be better to just forget portability and get something larger?  I really just want something to power my headphones when I'm laying around doing school work.  But having something portable seems like a plus!

1,"Getting headphones/headset for ""free"" Hello!  
I work in a sales position where we can report our sales to a vendor and get some ‚Äúpoints‚Äù, the points can be used in a virtual store to buy stuff. I want to spend some of them on a new headphone/headset.  
I have made a list of all the available headsets and headphones I can choose from.   
I currently have some old Steelseries Siberia V2 that have broken 2-3 times but I have soldered them, added new wires, etc. and fixed them every time. I think I would like to be able to fix my new headphones in the future once/if they break, I‚Äôm not the type to change things often. I‚Äôve had the old ones for maybe 7-8 years currently, and I wouldn‚Äôt change them if it wasn‚Äôt for the points and the fact I could get a new one for free basically.

I found out I could ‚Äúcheese‚Äù the points system a bit by buying gift cards at a store through the rewards program and get access to more headphones. I will list these separately, and if possible would like to get recommendations from both lists.  
Here‚Äôs the lists of what I can pick from, which ones would you guys recommend?  


**Points/rewards headphones:** [**https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz\_gRlcwKDFhjDPDRa-Tze40FoyTj9f0yCCeGbQbj78/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz_gRlcwKDFhjDPDRa-Tze40FoyTj9f0yCCeGbQbj78/edit?usp=sharing)   
**Gift card audio store:** [**https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JBm2Z49B9gFkumdK5ezM1OQQWFwX25bJKmvpM9UsxU/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JBm2Z49B9gFkumdK5ezM1OQQWFwX25bJKmvpM9UsxU/edit?usp=sharing)   


* **Budget** \- N/A (But for the ones listed under ‚ÄúGift Card Audio Store‚Äù in my list I want to keep it around 4200 NOK (around 500 USD) or below to not spend all my points.
* **Source** \- Plugging them into my PC, but might get a DAC or amp if it‚Äôs highly recommended and I can find one in the ‚Äúrewards store‚Äù or an associated gift card shop.
* **Requirements for Isolation** \- I don‚Äôt think I want open back as it might annoy the other people in the house, I never close the door to where I sit, as I often talk/yell to people in other rooms and they do the same to me. I might also want to be able to hear a bit while wearing them, I like hearing my own voice a bit when I talk (otherwise i often talk too loud).
* **Will you be using these Headphones in Public?** No I will not.
* **Preferred Type of Headphone** \- Full sized, will use them mainly for playing video games while voice chatting with people. side-usage = voice calls and listening to music.
* **Preferred tonal balance** \- Not sure, probably balanced? will mainly use them for gaming and some music listening and voice calls.
* **Past headphones** \- Had Steelseries Siberia V2 before and some others I forgot. They were OK, but I think I prefer foam pads over fake leather as it can get sweaty and clampy sometimes, but this is not that big of a deal as long as they are comfortable.
* **Preferred Music** \- Rock, metal,synthwave mostly (I listen to stuff from pop to death metal, mainly more ‚Äúhard‚Äù stuff though) but I think this is irrelevant for my usage.
* **What would you like to improve on from your set-up** \- Something High-end that is good for gaming mostly and audio-positioning in games, better sound and more comfortable to wear.
* **Country:** Norway, but I think this is irrelevant as I have to pick from a list.
* **Most important features for me:** Must be comfortable and have good sound quality (most important of all)**,** I often use my headphones in a long sitting.Must work with PC. Should be great for gaming (mainly for FPS audio positioning). The mic only needs to be average and above.
* **Other preferences: 1.** Would prefer audio jacks, not USB. **2.** Would also prefer wired and not wireless. **3.** Think I would prefer foam pads or something similar instead of the fake leather. **4.** Might prefer closed back, or is the sound leakage not that high?.  **5.** Might prefer the headset to have a microphone, but I can also get one separately if it‚Äôs available through the points/rewards program. NOTE: If a headset is vastly superior to another, then these preferences can be ignored.

**Notes: 1.** I am fine with buying a separate mic if I can find it through the rewards or gift card program. **2.** I am also OK with buying a DAC/separate audio card if I can get one through the rewards or gift program. I currently do not have a DAC or an amp. I plug the headphones directly into the front plugs of my PC usually.

And so just after I received it, it was black Friday and there was an amazing deal on the HD6xx, which i paid 161 USD + shipping for. which is insanely cheap in Europe, even with additional 25% import tax and 30$ to local shipping company because they had to pay and declare tax for me.(that's how it is when ordering from outside Europe)

I originally got the HD58x for both music and gaming, but since i got the 6xx aswell, i thought they sound pretty close, and that maybe i should sell/trade the jubilee for an hd560s maybe?

[SHP9500, MDR-1000X, and ZSN PRO X](https://preview.redd.it/o7hz1v25deb81.jpg?width=2620&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f67345671cd6e0c32459cef18f4d2cba768df11)

SHP9500  
My daily driver for 5 years now. It was a gift from my audiophile friend. Neutral to bright. Widest of the bunch. Quite exiting, blend things quite well which also makes them bad at instrument separation and layering. It struggles with busy tracks. It's got airy-ness to it, which makes it nice to listen to jazz, classical, and acoustic tracks. Can be shouty and sibilant at times. If I were to upgrade, I'd probably go for 560S, waiting for the pads to wither away. Main reason for daily drive is it's not fussy, no charging and no trying to untangle the cable from the headphone (unlike IEM's)

MDR-1000X  
My go to portable audio. Bought used for 2 mil IDR (122 EUR, take that yanks!). Had it not sounding different (worse) through wire and has to rely on the bats, I'd probably use them more on desktop. It sounds chill. While yes it is V-shaped with warm tilt I rarely carve for the mids to be more forward. Soundstage is wider than something like ATH-M series. It's detailed enough to surprise me from time to time. I see a lot of people lately shite on the XM4 and 3, from anecdote I think sony's trying to have the audiophile community approval  and then slowly muddying it up by bloating the bass to appeal to the normies (tinfoil hat stuff this).

Tin T2  
I lost it about 1-2 years ago. People called it neutral, but I thought it was neutral-bright and this is coming from someone who daily drive SHP. Maybe because it was in ear? It was the first time I heard an open sounding IEM. I like it being top down, but I despise the cable. Phone nowdays are tall, if I pocket them with T2 cable plugged I can't sit. It has too much of the grippy bit  and too little strain relief. It's a easy to drive IEM, don't pretend that it's a hard to drive heavy duty hifi equipment. Also both earpiece and cable starts to loosen after 1 year. I know this because I test it with someone else's IEM.

KZ ZSN Pro X  
Honestly, I'd rather the samsung earphone that came with S series and up (was it?). I prefer cable down ones, the over ear cable rarely fit me comfortably. Then there's the sound V shape, not the chill one at that. It sounds like it's trying hard to give you a 'clear' sound. And I constantly miss the mids. It sounds like the mic used for recording been covered by layers of thick windshield and pop filters. The bass well extended, the mids although too recessed honestly is fine, but the treble is gritty. Also it somewhat sounds artificial, maybe because it's timbre issue. Overall it sounds fine, a decent starter perhaps.

Next is Quarks, it's on the way.

INTRO: Hi guys! I recently hopped on the $990 Focal Clear train on Headphones.com like many others here. Took me a couple sleepless night before making the purchase especially since it was not only my first kilobuck headphones but also a final sale item. What essentially pushed me to do it were 1) They‚Äôre about to be discontinued, so the resale value should be pretty stable in the future 2) They have amazing reviews and just simply look gorgeous. 3) Upgraditis lol

Anyway, I‚Äôve been using a DT 1990 pro for the past several months (and absolutely loving them), and I‚Äôve decided to write a comparison between the two since both of them are highly popular headphones. Like the title said, I‚Äôm not an audiophile by any means, and will therefore avoid professional jargons and terms. If you want professional reviews there are plenty to be found on YouTube.

***Short Preface:*** 

The DT 1990 pro I‚Äôm using are with the Dekoni Velour Pads. Plenty have been written about them already, so I don‚Äôt think I need to elaborate on how they affect the sound compared to the stock pads. I‚Äôm also using a Schitt stack (Modi 3+ &amp; Magni 3+) to drive them.

I‚Äôll also compare the two headphones in terms of their stock sounds AND after EQ, since I find it more interesting (and fairer) to compare two headphones once they have the similar sound signatures. I applied Oratory EQ for both headphones since those EQ values are supposed to produce very similar sound signatures. 

Let‚Äôs go!

***SOUND:***

**BASS-**

STOCK SOUND:

Very similar between the two to my ears. If you like bass both of these headphones will satisfy your need without questions. Clear maybe hits SLIGHTLY deeper than the DT 1990, but both are clean and impactful. I mainly listen to Angel by Massive Attack to test them.

**DT 1990 = Focal Clear**

AFTER EQ:

Very interesting result. After EQ, DT 1990‚Äôs bass is elevated. They hit deeper, harder‚Ä¶but also noticeably muddier. It still feels clean and impactful compared to 99% of the headphones in that price range, but compared to the Clear‚Ä¶the Clear hit as deep, as hard, and STILL maintain the speed and the crispiness. In fact I even turned up the bass several DB higher, and amazed at just how clean the Clear‚Äôs bass response is.

So, without EQ, the bass between the two are quite similar. After EQ, Clear has better and cleaner bass for sure.

**Focal Clear &gt; DT 1990** 

   
 

**MID:**

STOCK SOUND:

Clear has better mid, period. DT 1990‚Äôs mid feels recessed in comparison. Clear feels A LITTLE shouty at times, and every now and then I did hear the ‚Äúmetallic‚Äù quality that some people have been referring to. That only bothered me in the very beginning when I was still used to the DT 1990‚Äôs more laidback vocal.

**Focal Clear &gt; DT 1990** 

AFTER EQ:

Clear wins hands down. DT 1990, despite the EQ, still feels recessed. In fact they don‚Äôt just feel recessed, but THINNER. I had to turn up the mid (for some reason the Oratory EQ turned down the mid instead) a few DB to get the sound that I like. Clear, on the other hand, fixed all my problem with the mid after EQ. 

**Focal Clear &gt; DT 1990** 

   
 

**TREBLE**

STOCK SOUND:

Now, this will be controversial. To start off, I LOVE DT 1990‚ÄôS treble (again, I‚Äôm using the Dekoni Velour pads). I was raised playing multiple instruments including violin, and the treble on the DT 1990 create the best violin sound I‚Äôve ever heard on any headphones, period. Yes, they do get sibilant every now and then whether in music or in spoken words, but to me it‚Äôs a fair trade off.

Clear‚Äôs treble underwhelmed me. Compared to DT 1990 they feel recessed, and instruments just sound boring. Yes, I understand that to some people Clear already has a pronounced treble, and if you‚Äôre one of those people who absolutely cannot tolerate DT 1990 treble, then I figure Clear will be just the right amount for you. For me, DT 1990 win the round.

**DT 1990 &gt; Focal Clear**

AFTER EQ

This becomes a much fairer match after EQ. The Clear finally has that sparkles that I‚Äôm looking for, and become much better headphones instead. Similarly, after EQing the treble down on the DT 1990, they still maintain the amazing sound of the instruments, but without the sibilance. 

Frankly, I MIGHT still pick the DT 1990 for treble even after EQ, but only ever so slightly. The violins just‚Ä¶sound SOOO good on them. Objectively, I‚Äôll rate them both the same.

**DT 1990 = Focal Clear**

   
 

**Soundstage &amp; Imaging‚Ä¶and other audiophile jargons**

So I‚Äôm not great at hearing and describing ‚Äúimaging‚Äù or ‚Äúsoundstage,‚Äù I can only describe what I hear and feel instead. 

Frankly, this is the one area where DT 1990 wins out for me, and sadly, this is also the only area that EQ can‚Äôt fix. Again, growing up playing many instruments (I was in concert band, orchestra, jazz band, marching band, everything you can think of), DT 1990 are the first pair of headphones that actually allow me to hear so many different instruments and pinpoint where they are in separation. (I guess this is what the audiophiles call ‚Äúinstrument separation‚Äù)

I don‚Äôt know if Clear sound ‚Äúintimate‚Äù like many other reviewers have said, but they do sound less wide with less depth than the DT 1990. The instruments DO feel crammed together compared to the DT 1990, and it took away some of the enjoyment while listening to music since I greatly enjoy picking out different instruments in a song. 

This makes DT 1990 better for video games and movies where you kinda want sound to come in from each direction for immersion and precision. 

After listening to DT 1990 for months, it took me a couple days to get used to the smaller and shallower soundstage of the Clear, and honestly, I might‚Äôve returned them if I could‚Äôve at that point. Now, I sort of enjoy‚Ä¶or more like ACQUIRED the taste of the smaller stage of Clear. But again, if what you LOVE about the DT 1990 are the instrument separation and the depth of the soundstage, Focal Clear are much inferior in those aspects.

**DT 1990 &gt; Focal Clear**

   
 

**TL:DR**

Both headphones have their strengths and weaknesses. Focal Clear, as a whole, SOUND better in pretty much every aspect, especially after EQ. DT 1990, however, win for me in terms of soundstage and instrument separation. DT 1990 are still an amazing pair of headphones, and Clear are definitely not twice as good as them‚Ä¶but hey, this hobby is all about diminishing returns, ain‚Äôt it? 

At the end of the day, **I found DT 1990 more fun in picking out instruments and better for games and movies. The Clear are better for general music enjoyment and impact.**",dt pro focal clear non audiophile impression intro hi guy recently hopped focal clear train headphone many others took couple sleepless night making purchase especially since first kilobuck headphone final sale item essentially pushed discontinued resale value pretty stable future amazing review simply look gorgeous upgraditis lol anyway using dt pro past several month absolutely loving decided write comparison two since highly popular headphone title said audiophile mean therefore avoid professional jargon term want professional review plenty found youtube short preface dt pro using dekoni velour pad plenty written already think need elaborate affect sound compared stock pad using schitt stack modi magni drive compare two headphone term stock sound eq since find interesting fairer compare two headphone similar sound signature applied oratory eq headphone since eq value supposed produce similar sound signature let go sound bass stock sound similar two ear bass headphone satisfy need without question clear maybe hit slightly deeper dt clean impactful mainly listen angel massive attack test dt focal clear eq interesting result eq dt bass elevated hit deeper harder noticeably muddier still feel clean impactful compared headphone price range compared clear clear hit deep hard still maintain speed crispiness fact even turned bass several db higher amazed clean clear bass response without eq bass two quite similar eq clear cleaner bass sure focal clear dt mid stock sound clear mid period dt mid feel recessed comparison clear feel little shouty time every hear metallic quality people referring bothered beginning still used dt laidback vocal focal clear dt eq clear win hand dt despite eq still feel recessed fact feel recessed thinner turn mid reason oratory eq turned mid instead db sound clear hand fixed problem mid eq focal clear dt treble stock sound controversial start love dt treble using dekoni velour pad raised playing multiple instrument including violin treble dt create best violin sound ever heard headphone period yes sibilant every whether music spoken word fair trade clear treble underwhelmed compared dt feel recessed instrument sound boring yes understand people clear already pronounced treble people absolutely cannot tolerate dt treble figure clear right amount dt win round dt focal clear eq becomes much fairer match eq clear finally sparkle become much headphone instead similarly eqing treble dt still maintain amazing sound instrument without sibilance frankly might still pick dt treble even eq ever slightly violin sound sooo objectively rate dt focal clear soundstage imaging audiophile jargon great hearing describing imaging soundstage describe hear feel instead frankly area dt win sadly area eq fix growing playing many instrument concert band orchestra jazz band marching band everything think dt first pair headphone actually allow hear many different instrument pinpoint separation guess audiophiles call instrument separation clear sound intimate many reviewer said sound le wide le depth dt instrument feel crammed together compared dt took away enjoyment listening music since greatly enjoy picking different instrument song make dt video game movie kinda want sound come direction immersion precision listening dt month took couple day used smaller shallower soundstage clear honestly might returned could point sort enjoy acquired taste smaller stage clear love dt instrument separation depth soundstage focal clear much inferior aspect dt focal clear tl dr headphone strength weakness focal clear whole sound pretty much every aspect especially eq dt however win term soundstage instrument separation dt still amazing pair headphone clear definitely twice hey hobby diminishing return end day found dt fun picking instrument game movie clear general music enjoyment impact

1,"Recommended headphones &amp; amp for acoustic and orchestral music Need some advice on headphones and amp pairings. Ideally keeping the total below or not much above $1000.

I listen to a wide array of music types (jazz, classical, electro-acoustic, avant garde electronic, rock, noise) but would argue that my default is 50's-60's jazz (Mingus, Monk, Miles second quintet). If I had to pick one thing to aim for, it would be headphones that best present the sound of an acoustic upright bass. I generally prefer musicality over accuracy.

Never had open back headphones, nor planar magnetics, but I am intrigued. I've been looking at Audeze LCD-2c after seeing a bunch of YouTube reviews, but also at Hifiman Sundara.

For amps I'm looking mostly at various Schiit amps from Fulla/Hel to Lyr (with DAC) and Valhalla. Very interested in tube amps, but am unsure about the pairing. Also been looking at portable amps like Audioquest's Red and Cobalt.

1,"New guy venturing into audiophile world needs help! Ive always been a guy who picked up nuances in every audio imaginable, so always hated most of the earphones that we get from mainstream companies. I came in to light with the iems not so long ago, but at the current financial state i cant go for the premium ones, rather im trying to find the correct sound signature i might prefer. Finally ive locked on to 3 iems, all of them fairly cheap. Help me find one to start my journey. Ill also add a reason why i try to not opt the iem specifically so that you can get the correct one for me.

Kz zsn pro x- only negative i hear is the treble is too harsh and the much bulky build doesnt feel comfortable comparing the rest of iems.

Kz zex- they are saying its electrostatic but everyone else is saying its just a marketing gimmick

Kz dq6- 3 dynamic drivers. Is it really better than the zsn pros hybrid drivers?

1,"Another 6xx disappointment post.. So i just received them few minutes ago,

i plug it to my amp fiio e10k then new released fiio ka3, and i started to questioning the people in this hobby,

i know sound is subjective but this sound is way too muddy for me, the mid is ok, it missing a lot of detail/treble and the high is too extended. Bass is not pronounced, it sound too spread, it lack thump but at the same time it make it sound muddy, i say it have more high bass than mid bass.

i daily drive denon d2000, and guess what denon sound way open despite it being a closed back. Denon sound bassy too but its not overly muddy like 6xx, the mid sound more organic and lifelike, the treble have slightly detail than 6xx, the high is better.

how the heck open back sound so closed than closed back.

i have few earbud too, and i use totl earbud Shozy Bk/Stardust for sleeping, shozy beat hd6xx by large margin, way more detail, more treble/high, way more natural mids, the only weakness of shozy is the bass and soundstage. The Faeal Rosemary 120 ohm have more soundstage than 6xx, wth that is earbud you know.

i don't know why some people say it need powerful amp to unleash it's potential, i only use 10% of rotary knob on the amp and it sound loud enough to me (i bet i must be one of the people who listen on low volume level) the point is i don't think the amp is the problem, even if i upgrade to more expensive amp i don't think it will appeal enough to me.

i will give it a listen for a few day i guess, maybe this is just reaction from the first listen,

i will give it a chance, maybe i'm not audiophile enough and cannot fathom this sound.

i feel that i expected it to be more than it suppose to be, based on the rave reviews and how people treat it like goldmine in audio world.

i should have gone with Sundara instead.

Do i regret the purchase? nope, because it i got it used with a great price in a great condition, basically new. (maybe the ex owner regret the purchase too) i can give this to my sibling.

1,"left channel acts as master vol, right channel does nothing  

Hello, I recently bought a new Logitech G433 headset and am having issues with the left right audio channels. I have it plugged into a Rainer Microphone that I was using with my last headset. When I play games such as Rust or Tarkov the audio is very good in the left channel but very quiet in the right channel. when I'm watching YouTube or whatnot the audio is the same volume on both sides.

In the balance tab of the sounds ui on windows the left channel sound acts as if it were a master volume and the right channel makes no difference at all.

When I use the provided 3.4mm to usb adapter thing its the same problem but I don't even have balance sliders,

Its almost impossible to tell where people are (left, right, behind, front) on tarkov and I can barely manage on rust. I have reinstalled the ""Realtek"" drivers as windows support suggested but I have not been able to reconnect to the support tab after restarting my pc.

I am fine either using the adapter or my mic, either works fine for me

BIAS FX 2, The program I use for my guitar only offers a stereo output, although I don't know how to test the ability of that

Anny suggestions are welcome and appreciated.

My M1HPA is about ten years old and for a few days I had the feeling it sounded a bit off in certain songs at higher volumes. I tried the headphones port on my stereo amp and it really seems to be the amp.

It probably has a few thousand listening hours, so I figure that a cap might have gone bad. 

Is there any way to reliably test for clipping without a Multimeter or Osciloscope, since I am not sure if I trust my ears on this one. 

Thanks",headphone amp seems clip hi hpa ten year old day feeling sounded bit certain song higher volume tried headphone port stereo amp seems amp probably thousand listening hour figure cap might gone bad way reliably test clipping without multimeter osciloscope since sure trust ear thanks
1,"Why Do People Claim Openback is Better For Gaming? I can't reply on the threads I want cause they are like 7 years old but people really be saying Openback is better because of the ""soundstage"" which imo is a vague reasoning behind the claim. I'm gonna break it down how my mind perceives open and closedback. 

For starters, what is a soundstage? Soundstages allow you to have perception of sounds without visuals (basically). Your ability to perceive where and what is making a certain noise. Openback headsets allow for sound leakage and for ambient noise to enter your ear. So with sound leaking out and ambient noise leaking in how is the user given a superior soundstage when compared to it's closedback counterpart? 

Closedback block out your ambient noise and keep all your sounds contained inside your ear, allowing for much better sound accuracy and better sound information. With the sound not leaking out of the muff, you can get all the information you need without hearing your neighbor mow his damn lawn. 

For a gaming environment, you want to be able to hear everything, but accurately. I can't make sense on being able to aquire accurate sound information if you have sounds leaking in and out of the headset. 

The one counter argument I see people use is echo (I only see studio heads use this argument) and how sounds can bounce around inside the earmuff. I've been daily driving a 250ohm (high pressure) closedback headset and have only ran into that echo issue if the cans are MAXED tf out 100% volume. But if you are maxing out a closedback headset I think you might need some hearing aids.

For $20, I experienced not a single disconnection. No issues on pairing. The battery is superb at 20 hrs I think. I haven't even drained it yet. I will never go back to TWS lol.

The sound quality is pretty much the same as wired. Very little diffence. The APTX is awesome. I am using KZ EDX. 

It looks good too and doesn't feel cheap. The comfort is great. It has this band so they wont slip over your neck. Though the earhooks are subpar.

The controls are great addition. Though phone audio wont be adjusted when no audio is playing on phone. Not a big issue anyway. 

Yes there is indeed latency but it's decent. I can do my transcription job fine.

The only thing I hate about it is the beep sound when you  mute your device or go max volume.

So yeah, I am really impressed by the quality of this Bluetooth adapter. Money well spent!

I was shopping (and will take recommendations) for buds or phones and wanted to ask if Bluetooth 5.0 would solve this problem? Or is there something else I should be looking out for?

1,"AutoEQ Question Forgive me if I make any mistakes with what I'm saying here. Because, I'm still trying to figure this out.

I was able to finally get the AutoEQ cmd thing to work and generate my own headphones conversions. From what I understand, sans the input and output directories, I have to use ""compensation="" if I'm to convert my headphones to sound like the Harman Target or diffused field or etc. And if I were to convert my headphones to another one (say, SHP 9500 to HD560s), I just use ""sound\_signature="" after the ""compensation="" (and bass\_boost=4) and it will add the sound signature of the target headphone on the compensation. Ok, got it.

Now, here's the question: Why can't I just skip the ""sound\_signature="" all together and just directly input it in the ""compensation="" (and remove bass boost) if compensation is basically just tuning it to‚Äîwhat is essentially‚Äîanother signature? 

Like, instead of:

    --compensation=""measurements\rtings\resources\rtings_harman_over-ear_2018_wo_bass.csv"" --sound_signature=""measurements\rtings\data\onear\Sennheiser HD 560S\Sennheiser HD 560S.csv""

...why can't I just go and do:

    --compensation=""measurements\rtings\data\onear\Sennheiser HD 560S\Sennheiser HD 560S.csv""

Yes, I have tried both and have generated their results:

Long story short, while low-bass seems to be practically similar, the mid-bass to mid-mid is lower on the 1st test than on the 2nd test (disregard the treble, for now).

1,"HE400SE (China ver.) first impressions [vs. SHP9500] Just got my HE400se today. I wanted to try planar headphones and saw these for sale in our local e-commerce site for around $90 (converted). My old headphones are the SHP9500 which I've owned for around 1 year. Many people will be looking at the same upgrade path so I'll share some impressions and comparisons. 

For some A/B testing, the SHP was powered by an apple dongle connected to a windows PC; the 400SE was powered by a JCALLY JM20 dongle (It gets plenty loud at 30 windows volume). 

Out of the box, the difference between the sound signatures of the two headphones are apparent. The SHPs are bright, the 400se sounds almost laid back compared to the SHPs. The 400se is, hands down, better tuned.

The bass on the two units are also different. The 400se is less punchy but cleaner, the SHPs have a midbass boost so they're a bit punchier. As for extension, the two units are pretty similar. I have yet to hear ""planar bass""

For the mids, the 400se can get a bit recessed in some tracks but not very much. I would not describe the high mids as veiled but it might appear as such if you came from the SHP. The mids on the SHPs are pretty good (at least for me).

For the highs, this is where the cans differ a lot. The SHPs can sound harsh, sibilant, and fatiguing on tracks with plenty of cymbals or high frequency sound effects. The 400se is smoother, with less treble energy, but still provides impressive detail. It's somewhat like the SHPs are forced to produce the highs while the 400se just does it effortlessly. 

For comfort, SHP wins. The 400se's headband is kinda ass, and the extension is pretty short (I maxed out a headphone extension for the first time lol, and I don't really have a big head). The clamp is not too tight. The earpads are comfortable but a little too small for my liking. 

Is it an upgrade? Yes. While the SHPs are not bad (in my opinion) the 400SE is just straight up the more coherently-tuned headphone. If you're thinking about buying either, go for the 400SE.",se china ver first impression v shp got se today wanted try planar headphone saw sale local e commerce site around converted old headphone shp owned around year many people upgrade path share impression comparison b testing shp powered apple dongle connected window pc se powered jcally jm dongle get plenty loud window volume box difference sound signature two headphone apparent shps bright se sound almost laid back compared shps se hand tuned bass two unit different se le punchy cleaner shps midbass boost bit punchier extension two unit pretty similar yet hear planar bass mids se bit recessed track much describe high mids veiled might appear came shp mids shps pretty least high can differ lot shps sound harsh sibilant fatiguing track plenty cymbal high frequency sound effect se smoother le treble energy still provides impressive detail somewhat shps forced produce high se effortlessly comfort shp win se headband kinda as extension pretty short maxed headphone extension first time lol big head clamp tight earpads comfortable little small liking upgrade yes shps bad opinion se straight coherently tuned headphone thinking buying either go se

I was under the impression that since these are high ohm these could *only* be ran with a dedicated amp. But my Galaxy S10e pushes these just fine and even get louder than I'd want. 

They do sound clearer through my old Fiio E07K Andes DAC/AMP and a little muffled I guess through my phone but not *bad*.

1,"Just did a comparison of four closed back headphones, and boy was I surprised Firstly, music is very important to me. I listen in the car, when I'm working, when I'm reading, when I'm working out, when I'm mowing or when I'm just watching the critters in my backyard.


I'm not a music critic, so hopefully what I've written is clear enough. I'm going to keep this somewhat brief.


I've owned the Sennheiser HD280 Pro since 2010, Sennheiser PXC550 since 2018, the Focal Stellia since 12/2021 and the Meze Classics 99 since a week ago. (I also own Sennheiser Momentum TW2, Sennheiser 300CX, Klipsch TY 2, After Shockz Aeropex)


I powered all the headphones through a Qudelix 5k. I tested them on flat EQ as well as using [settings from oratory1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/9o2f5n/psa_oratory1990s_list_of_eq_presets/) All the media was Flac.


I had read so many amazing reviews about the Focal Stellia that I really wanted them. I was really expecting it to surprise me with it's sound. Boy was I disappointed. No matter what I tried (different music, different EQ settings, etc.), I just wasn't impressed with it. So I ordered the Meze Classics 99, which also had amazing reviews. The Meze is 1/10th the price of the Stellia! Right out of the box, the Meze kicked ass. The sound was amazing no matter what I listened to.


I've always loved the HD280's and it was my reference point. Testing it side by side with the Stellia and the Classics 99 actually made me sad because I could tell very clearly that as good as it sounded, it just wasn't in the same class as the Meze Classics 99.


What did I test these cans with?

**NIN:**

Something I can never have

Satellite

Closer

Ghosts (21-24)


**Miles Davis:**

Kind of Blue

Bitches Brew


**The Crystal Method:**

Blowout

High Roller


**Led Zeppelin:**

When the levee breaks

Dazed and Confused


**Beethoven:**

Fidelio, Op. 72, Act 1: No. 9 Abscheulicher! wo eilst du hin

Cello Sonata No. 3 in A major, Op. 69: III. Adagio cantabile - Allegro vivace


**Black Angels:**

Young Men Dead


**Massive Attack:**

Angel

Mezzanine


**Bottomline:**

Which is the best headphone of my collection? **Meze Classics 99.**

I wanted to give the Stellia the benefit of the doubt and say that which headphone won would depend on the kind of music, but I just could not defeat the Meze. It handled that list above with absolute class. The trebles were beautiful, the bass was roomy and large on Massive Attack's Angel and tight on Nine Inch Nail's Ghosts 24. Every instrument on Fidelio was clear, distinct and beautiful. Miles' trumpets made me stop everything I was doing.


I know some of you are going to shake your head and go ""This guy doesn't know what good headphones are."" My conclusion is that if you are able to try cans of such a wide range of quality side by side, you'll be able to tell the difference very quickly. I really didn't think the differences would be so stark, but I was really surprised. And then you just have to pick the one that SOUNDS THE BEST TO YOU!

The Sundara are able to pick the music into so many little levels and place them all anywhere in its soundstage, which is awesome. They're also so fast and able to play metal songs with much less distortion. And, yes, the bass has a rolloff. But the impact the bass does have, despite said rolloff, is awesome.

1,"iFi ZEN DAC v2 - disconnecting after while - fix I'm the owner of the mentioned DAC from five days paired with Beyerdynamic DT990 PRO 80 Ohm - they sound way better than my previous Sennheiser PXC 550. But the last two days, I spent figuring out why they're randomly disconnecting from my PC with ubuntu operating system, but it can be applied to other flavours. So I want to share solution what I found, sooner or later someone will fall into this issue. Without further ado, this is the recipe:

The issue is disconnecting DAC/AMP iFi ZEN DAC v2 in random time.

Probably system detect idle run of the hardware and disconnect device. Two place where we can change behaviour for this device is pulse audio configuration and USB system power rules.

The first one:

1. Run in text editor with superuser privileges /etc/pulse/default.pa

i.e. `sudo vim /etc/pulse/default.pa`

&amp;#x200B;

2. Search line responsible for suspending sink or sources

`load-module module-suspend-on-idle`

and remove or comment it with # character

&amp;#x200B;

3. Restart the pulse daemon

`systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service`

&amp;#x200B;

The second:

1. Run in text editor with superuser privileges /etc/udev/rules.d/xx-usb\_power\_save.rules. In my case, the full name of the file is 50-usb\_power\_save.rules but in your case can be any other number.

i.e. `sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb\_power\_save.rules`

&amp;#x200B;

2. If you have any entry looking at this

`ACTION==""add"", SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""xxxx"", ATTR{idProduct}==""xxxx"", GOTO=""power\_usb\_rules\_end""`

provide next one after them, probably it should look like this

`ACTION==""add"", SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""20b1"", ATTR{idProduct}==""3008"", GOTO=""power\_usb\_rules\_end""`

But if you want to be confident about vendor and product ID, run

`lsusb`

and search ""XMOS Ltd iFi (by AMR) HD USB Audio"". You should change this numbers if they are different.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Reload the rules by

`udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; udevadm trigger`

or just restart pc.

1,"is $275 dollars for Airpods Max a steal? I just ordered a pair of Airpods Max because I needed a solid pair of wireless over ear headphones. When I visited an apple store, I tried the Airpods Max and I personally fell in love with their sound, quality, and especially comfort. The headphones were so comfortable and the sound was pretty crisp i was really impressed and had my mouth literally gaping open in awe. So after a month or so, I told myself ""screw it"" just find a reasonable one online. I logged on to Depop and I saw this one person selling them for originally $400.  I thought that was good deal since the original price was a whopping $550. Personally I think the Airpods max are not even close to being $550 worth, they're worth 250 at best. I talked the seller down and they were really nice and they said they can do $275! Which is basically half the retail price. I'm one of those who hunt for good deals on anything I purchase so I had to jump on this offer. From the pictures, they're amazing condition for basically brand new Airpods max except its out the plastic wrap. 

However, I already have a new pair of Airpods Pros, so I'm not sure if I went over kill or not, because I have a MacBook Air, a iPhone SE 2020, and a Airpod pros for my Apple ecosystem.

For example, some songs I listen to and in games with good 3D audio, I feel as though I can hear sounds around me more accurately (in terms of position around my head in a 360 degree space) than headphones.

1,"Sony WF-1000XM4 vs. Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Quick In-Store Comparison Review Been wavering between XM4s and L3Ps for a while. Finally got some time to go try them out in the retails few days ago. Here are my thoughts (I am not an audiophile, just your average casual listener):

**Sound Quality**
*Compared without installing app (so no EQ tweaking).
*With the same music source, L3P sounds much more fun, vibrant, more apparent low/mid/high separation to me.
*XM4 sounds more relatively dull, warm, just not as fun. (I understand this could be vastly improved with EQ, but I'm skeptical. There is a huge difference here.)
*For both, if listened independently, both can be considered very good and fun enough.

**Feel in the ears**
*Good stability for both. Could withstand the most violent head-motion.
*XM4 fills the entire ear. Feels very stable, but very stuffy after a while (could imagine if worn for hours I'd sweat in ear). Wouldn't want to wear for extended periods of time, especially during hot weather.
*LP3 feels much lighter and less stuffy, but lots of wiggle-room. Could wear them for more extended periods of time.

**Touch control**
*XM4 feels much more stable/reliable due to its stability in ears. Feels much more premium in tapping.
*L3P feels less reliable in tapping due to the aforementioned wiggle room, and less premium.
*From reviews online, L3P touch controls are much more customizable than XM4s, so this should be something going for the L3Ps (just not the premium feel).

**Active Noise Cancelling**
*XM4 is a no-brainer. When activated, I'm feel very isolated from the noisy world. It cancels out low/mid/mid-high frequencies.
*L3P only really cancels out low frequencies. Anything above mid feels only dimmed passively.
*Not sure how they fare on airplanes / public transportations against engine noises (this is my main function for ANC).
*For XM4s, it takes 1~2 seconds for ANC to kick in (after it announces the mode) after mode-switching or putting into ear. Once it kicks in, the feel of difference is amazingly immense.
*L3Ps just kicks in instantly, but the feel of difference is very mild. Sometimes I feel no difference, and have to persuade myself there much be difference.

**Ear tips**
*XM4 uses foam ear tips, but for the demo unit in retail, the XM4 tips seem hardened and...kind of gross. Apparently these consume much faster. (nevertheless ANC works wonders)
*Could've played a role in the ANC performance. Not sure. But personally (ANC not considered), I prefer the traditional silicone ear tips.

**Charging Case**
*XM4's case feels slightly more premium than L3P's case, though both feel cheaper than, say, Sony's predecessor (XM3s).
*XM4 has the satisfying magnetic click upon shutting. But the L3P's sliding mechanism isn't bad either. Just not sure about the durability of both.

**Removing and placing earbuds from and into the charging case**
*XM4 feels very intuitive in positioning, while L3P is very awkward (you'll know if you try it yourself).
*Due to XM4's shape and material, it was kind of hard to take XM4's out of the magnetic case. The retailer had to help me once. But once taken out, it goes right into the ears very directly and intuitively.
*L3P's are not that easy to take out either, and I find myself having to resort to grabbing the ear-tips to take it out. And after taking it out, putting into ear takes some learning curve (again, awkward positioning).

**Transparency Mode**
*Didn't really care about this function, but tried anyways. Both feel similar.

That's all I got to try out in the retails. Battery life, connectivity/stability, audio lagging, and call quality I also care (especially stability) but could not test.

1,"1 Week With The Austrian Audio HI-X65 &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pw2whqrq5va81.jpg?width=996&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b6968a746e6436ba0e60de84f64594e5c8f1e8

(This is my 1 week review of the Austrian Audio X65. Please note comparisons with the HD600 and X65 are with EQ. I will have a small section in the beginning without EQ on both, and the majority will be with EQ, as I tend to EQ everything, including the HD600. My EQ profile will be at the end for both the HD600 and X65)

Well it has been quite a week with the HI-X65 by Austrian Audio and I believe I'm ready to make a review on them. Please note I am not an experienced audiophile by any means, I am a simply guy who works out, listens to metal music, and plays games. I do not really like audiophile terms, nor do I believe that amps/dacs play a major role in overall sound quality. I believe all SS amps sound the same and dacs are over-blown in terms of audio perception, same with soundstage and all that in headphones.  So let's dive in with that all out of the way!

First: The unboxing:

Like I mentioned in my first impressions, it still stands. The unboxing is really friggin' good. More flashy than the HD600 but not extremely over-done. It's the perfect amount of premium. It's like adding salt to foods, too much or too little can ruin a meal, but the right amount leaves a fantastic impression. Comes with a long and short cable, the short I think is like 4ft and the long is closer to 10 feet. Both use a 2.5mm locking connector to 3.5mm termination, includes a quarter inch termination jack. Cable is nice in my opinion.

Comfort/Fit: Probably even more subjective than sound is the fit. I personally found out the box to be quite nice, but the leather took a toll on my head at first and the clamp wasn't extremely strong, still stable, but not overly-clampy like the HD600 (that I absolutely love). I did bend the metal headband on the X65 to make it clamp a bit more and it's good now. The leather also seems to have ""broken in"" and now it's fine, but still retains that leather feeling that I wish I could swap for a velour style. Austrian Audio told me in a DM on Instagram that they had no intentions on making velour pads so.... good luck! You can remove the pads and put either the Dekoni or Brainwavz velour over the pads, however, the L and R foam or filter under the pads is glued or adhered to the structure. Removing that probably voids the warranty so I'd advise against that.    

With the current band bent, I can head bang without issue, just not like the HD600.

Sound: 

\[Without EQ - HD600\] - Tonally nice, a bit ""thick"" sounding in the midrange with good extension in the treble. Not sibilant like the DT 1990 I owned or dark-sounding like the Ether 2 that I also used to own. If you're opposed to EQ and only want that good mid-range, the HD600 is still you're choice between these two. The bass rolls off and is noticeable on Korn's debut where they love to put that &lt;100 hz action into their music. It's been beat to death, but without EQ, it's in-offensive and not going to rub anyone the wrong way unless you really, really want that low end.

\[Without EQ - X65\] - More treble (still not sibilant in my opinion), more extension in the low end (really solid extension if you ask me) , and some slight wonk in the mid range. Around 1.6k and 3.5k on my unit. Without EQ, I do think it's solid still, but guitars sounding slightly distant and vocals lacking slightly.

\[With EQ - HD600\] I don't add much EQ, but I boost the low end and the air, as well as 400 hz. It thickens the low end (1) quite a bit and makes bass more prominent, but sounds stuffy and a bit intrusive. Not saying that negatively, rather just what it sounds like. It's my EQ so like I tuned it myself to my ears, I like how it sounds, even if the description used sounds negative. With EQ, it's basically as good as it gets (or so I thought!). Instruments are nicely separated and placed well. I don't have issues with imaging in gaming or anything, but the stage is ""small"". 

I really have nothing more to say on the HD600, it's a staple in the audiophile community for a reason. And it still should be.

\[With EQ - X65\] Oh boy, does this thing take EQ well. So, while it has good extension, with a decent boost does it move some air on that low end. Again, referencing Korn here, on the song ""Ball Tongue"" and ""Falling Away from Me"", the sub and impact is extremely well controlled (in my opinion) and doesn't bleed at all. On the song ""Hollow"" by Rivers of Nihil, the absolutely crazy double kick drum (or whatever it is, again, I just like music) is well defined and well controlled. The driver seems fast enough to keep up with the speed and I can notice and hear each strike. I found the HD600 slightly less in this area (not by much). ""Chocolate Chip Trip"" -TOOL has noticeably more impact (2) and is almost too much sometimes.  A final notice here is ""Scream"" by Avenged Sevenfold, they'd said sub is in here and  I did notice it on other headphones, but with EQ on the X65 (even without EQ to a certain point) it is prominent but not over-powering.

Mids on the X65 when eq'd are a joy. Upping those ranges listed above really makes guitars come alive and vocals ever more present. I think EQ'd, I like the mids here more than the HD600 (3). Everything just sounds ""right"". The song ""Third Eye"" by TOOL has a section 7:55-8:45 where a lack of 1-2k is noticeable, (Hifiman) and with EQ it nails that section. Guitars sound full, full of body and life. Piano strokes on ""Warmness on the Soul"" - Avenged Sevenfold are prominent and delivered well. Overall, I like the midrange.

Highs/Treble is more noticeable on the X65 vs the HD600 but I think that has more to do with the increased soundstage more than anything. They're not sibilant, but are more noticeable. Cymbals and higher frequencies again are noticed, but not overpowering or shimmeringly-sibilant. I'm quite sensitive to higher end frequencies (specifically 6-9k) and I have no issue on the X65. ""Fear Inoculum"" and ""Chocolate Chip Trip"" can irritate me on some headphones (DT1990) and they don't on here at all. If you like the highs on the HD600 but wish that they were more noticeable, yea, this'll do it. There is a peak I think \~6k but it doesn't bother me to much, but YMMV.

Soundstage, Detail and Imaging/Separation: These have incredible imaging and instrument separation. Again, ""Chocolate Chip Trip"" - TOOL (or basically all of Fear Inoculum) makes use of this to a T. Instruments are clearly defined in their own space and I have no issue discerning them at all. ""Exist"" by Avenged Sevenfold has tons of things happening at once and not once do I feel instruments blend together in a negative way as to lose track of them. Imaging in gaming is also solid, no issues playing Halo Infinite or anything else. Soundstage is wider than the HD600, but like I stated in my impressions, they're headphones. You're not going to get phenomenal soundstage, but it is wider and it is nicer to have more room. There is also more detail (4) in these than the HD600. In the song ""Revenga"" by SOAD, at 2:11 there's a feint clicking noise amidst Daron's monologue and I never noticed it on the track until this headphone showed up. Detail is great and I have no complaints here.

Vocal seperation here is also superb, if a song has multi or layered vocals, the X65 has no issue displaying them. It's really beautiful to listen to when it happens. Like ""Die Alone (In Your Lovers Arms) by Holding Absense is just bliss on this headphone. (and also the HD600, just less so).

Conclusion: These are great headphones, but do need EQ to fully shine, if you're okay with EQ these are your ""mid-fi"" cans to look for. I like these more than the HD600, 560s, DT 1990, Ether 2, etc. I'm kinda an Austrian Audio shill at this point and I'm fine with that. They nailed it with these headphones, and am excited to see where they go from here.

Footnotes: 

(1) - Not sure if it's distortion or just how it sounds on my rig. But the lows do seem thicker and ""bloated"".

(2) - More impact could be because the X65 seal better than the HD600 due to the leather pads, creating more isolation and therefore less ""air"". But the impact is better regardless

(3) - Personal preference, but the drivers seem slower on the HD600, creating a thicker sounding midrange vs the faster drivers on the X65. 

(4) - I really have no idea what detail is, but this is my interpretation of it: Hearing more of music that wasn't noticeable or present in other headphones or audio sources.

I am based in Europe, I ordered the Monarch MKII and was already excited to post my impressions here, but: It doesn¬¥t fit, the left side is too large for me with any tip.

So I ask about sending them back, they say: No problem, just be aware that we will then charge a 35% ""restocking fee"". 350$!

So I check the consumer protection laws in Europe and, sure enough: this fee is illegal and they have to give me all the money back if they accept a return at all.

I tell them about this, they just reply: we are compliant with the law, if you don¬¥t like these conditions, sell privately.

So I call our consumer protection agency and get this advice: Yeah, technically this fee is illegal, but if you don¬¥t have insurance for this kind of thing, it will get expensive because China is hard to reach, and sometimes those companies don¬¥t respond at all and there is not much I can do from here.

I gave Linsoul one last chance and wrote them how scummy this is, but no matter the reply:

I was looking into some 2.5mm to 4.4mm adapters so I wouldn't have to get new cables, but I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews on many of the adapters saying they have had issues and possibly damaged their amps, although not all of the reviewers specified if they were using a 3.5 to 4.4 or 2.5 to 4.4mm adapter. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, as long as the cables are balanced, and the headphone output source is also balanced, then a 2.5mm to 4.4mm balanced adapter should be okay to use right?

However I narrowed down my option two both the Elegia and the HD700 and both seem to be bass lean with clean, and tight bass presence, but not nearly as lacking as the Aeon Flow Closed and seem to respond fairly well to EQ. Which of the two should I go for? I'm leaning more towards the HD700 just cause of the traits it has over the Elegia (large soundstage and warmth) and he seems more keen of open backs now that he's given the Aeon Flow Closed a try and we talked extensively about the HD700 and he seems fond of it. Though if there's any person who demoed both of them, please let me know how each compare to one another.

There seem to be two layers of noise, identifiable when music is just paused. There's a layer of white noise that remains for \~5s after pausing. And a layer of high-pitched buzz that remains for \~30s after pausing. The volume of noise doesn't seem related to the set volume. And it happens no matter which device I connect them to.

If I was really basting the volume then I imagine the noise ratio would be OK, but at lower volumes I can almost hear it while music is playing, and I know it's there, muddying the (otherwise \[in my opinion\] rather good) sound.

1,"DT 770 Pro 32 Ohm review These are the first pair of ""high quality"" headphones I've owned and there is a lack of proper reviews of the 32 ohm variant of the DT770s. So with this I hope to capture my thoughts as well as give interested people an idea of what to expect from these.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p4c6oukj2oa81.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f20c82d469374197a32e83132b2724e0cc66c37

Before I delve into the actual review, let me lay down some details. I have used these for a little over 3 months now. Initially used them with a Samsung type-c to 3.5mm dongle. Recently I've gotten my hands on a Qudelix 5k and have switched over to using that exclusively. I listen to music mainly on Spotify (Instrumentals, Metal, rock and occasionally some pop) and my preference is towards a warmer sound signature, with the most value given to clarity and separation of instruments. 

Starting with the build quality, these feel incredibly solid. The padding on the headband and around the ear is quite comfortable. The 32 ohm variants do not have the velour pads the other impedance models have, and so i would expect a difference in sound quality as well. The clamping force is on the higher side, and this coupled with the faux leather pads make these exceptional at noise isolation. You'd be hard pressed to hear absolutely anything from outside with music playing at even a low volume. The downside to this is that these make your ears warm quite easily and you'll have a hard time wearing this for long periods, especially in warmer/humid regions. The height adjustment is quite tight and requires some effort to adjust. It has the feel of something that is meant to be done sparingly, rather than frequently. The upside is that they hold onto your preferred position and do not necessitate frequent adjustment.

Moving on to the sound quality, I would describe these as very crisp and detailed with a little extra emphasis on the low end. The highs are very clear and quite pleasant most of the time. Though there is also some harshness at certain frequencies, which can lead to some hiss when certain instruments are playing. The instrument separation sounds really good to my ears, you will be able to pick out and focus on individual instruments even when the music gets chaotic. The bass is also really good and doesnt muddy the rest of the music. Its a tight focused sort of feel that you don't get with most mainstream wireless headphones. These sound a lot better once you've had the chance to EQ them. You'll be able to get rid of the harshness in the highs quite easily. These are quite capable and extremely pleasing to listen to once you've sorted out and tuned them to your liking. They especially shine with Metal and rock.

There isn't particularly much soundstage in my opinion. By virtue of the isolation alone you sort of lose a sense of depth. One other point that I would like to mention is that I found it really hard to get these loud. The low impedence suggensts that they should be well suited to mobile use, but thats not the case from my usage. From my phone, and when using the 3.5mm dongle, I was only able to get these as loud enough as ""I"" needed. The problem is I listen at a much lower volume than most people. When my brother wanted to try these, they wouldnt go as loud as he wanted. From a macbook pro 3.5mm port these can get much louder than out of a mobile jack, which leads me to believe that these do need some amount of amplification. The Qudelix 5k can get these extremely loud, so if you have something like that you should be fine.

1,"I need help with choosing entry level audiophile headphones I'm planning on buying a new pair of headphones and I need help with choosing the best pair. 

-Budget: ideally 100-200‚Ç¨, might stretch to 300 if they are really good. 

I will be using them in my room (quiet conditions), plugged in my pc and sometimes in my phone. I am looking for a pair that still provides decent sound without an amplifier. 

I look for (from personally the most to least important): 

-sound quality and richness
-comfort
-good bass abilities 

Choosing between:

-Sennheiser HD599
-Sennheiser HD58x
-Beyerdynamic DT 990 pro or DT 770 pro


I would appreciate if you would help me choose between those or give me some other similar options. I'd love to hear some quality but not mainstream headphones that could offer a lot for a cheaper price.

It's a super simple EQ, just a -5dB peaking filter at 11kHz with a (Q)uality of 3.

1,"Should Spotify add lossless music? When browsing this subreddit, I came across [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/ryyxcz/spotify_finally_comments_on_status_of_spotify_hifi/) talking about a recent update regarding lossless audio on Spotify. As someone who's always used Spotify, I was interested. I had heard some people talk about not being able to hear the difference, so I decided to test my hearing skills by taking an [ABX test](http://abx.digitalfeed.net/). Going into this, I was quite confident in my hearing. People have often praised me for pointing out sounds others couldn't hear (e.g. a high pitched noise in old tv's or in alarms). Suffice to say I was disappointed when I couldn't hear a single difference whilst taking the test‚Äîthe results reflected this. Surprised, and curious about whether this was normal, I made a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/rz49p0/can_you_hear_the_difference_between_lossless_and/) about it. 

# What is lossless anyway?

For the uninitiated, steaming services compress original music files, so that they take up less space. When doing so, however, some detail is lost. This type of music is called ""lossy"", and it's what Spotify currently uses. (Keep in mind that from here on I'll be referring to the highest quality available, being 320 kbps)  
Lossless music, however, isn't uncompressed, but rather compressed through a certain algorithm, which makes sure little to no detail is lost. Music processed in this way is called ""lossless"", and its quality is around 1,411 kbps.

# Results of the aforementioned poll

At the time of writing this, 228 people said that they *could* hear the difference, whilst 280 people said they *couldn't*. In the comments, many people pointed out that they could only hear the difference on songs they know really well, after a lot of A/B'ing in a quiet room, with their high-quality gear. Some people pointed out that they play an instrument, and that, if they focus really hard on said instrument, they'd be able to tell the difference. Moreover, most people agreed that the genre and recording quality played a huge role in their results. 

# Should Spotify add lossless music?

I would like to preface this part by mentioning that the following is my own opinion, based on the information I gathered. Feel free to share your opinion in the comments.  
Given that most Spotify users are listening through their cheap earbuds, whilst being on the go, and that even people with super high-end gear can barely hear the difference, I don't think there's much to gain by adding lossless music; it'll most likely make a minimal impact on their audience. Hence I conclude that Spotify most likely *won't* add lossless music, but, so as to give the devil his due, I've compiled some counterarguments.   
Seen as most other streaming services have adapted, some users might think Spotify is falling behind, and choose another platform. It thus wouldn't surprise me if they would add lossless just for the sake of keeping up with the competition. Furthermore, it might create a placebo effect on uniformed uses‚Äîwhich is most of their audience‚Äîleading them to believe that they're getting a huge increase in quality, even though they can't hear a difference. 

# Closing thoughts

Whatever Spotify decides to do, I'll keep on using it, as I can't tell any difference. I like Spotify for its intuitive interface, the great algorithm and my long history with it. If you're deciding on which platform to use, consider taking the test I linked earlier to see if lossless audio is really something you need. I'll be damned if I don't mention that Spotify pays their artists considerably less than their rivals, like Tidal and Apple Music, as can be seen in the picture below. This is also worth keeping in mind when making your decision  
Let me know what you think about this topic!

- Noticed that Impressions will be shot down If it goes against another impression/Review.

1,"Comparison write up: Hifiman Ananda vs Monoprice M1570 Closed I have the ananda and recently picked up the m1570 closed. I think I‚Äôm preferring the1570 closed overall. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison for those that might be interested in the ~$500 planar market.  

BASS: they have similar quality and extension but the ananda is a little better. It has better impact and takes more EQ before distortion, but the m1570 will surely satisfy just about everyone, especially if you use an amp with bass boost (eg ifi xbass), Loki, or use EQ. Without EQ they‚Äôre pretty much equal. 

MIDS: this came as a surprise to me but I prefer the mids on the m1570. After A/Bing the two, I can now see how the ananda is described by some as being ‚Äúthin‚Äù. The m1570 is smoother, denser, and more musical, but overall they‚Äôre fairly close. 

TREBLE: the ananda has a lot more air and such, but it‚Äôs open so it‚Äôs not a fair comparison. They‚Äôre both really neutral and have great extension I think. The m1570 is really good here, it‚Äôs not lacking for detail and has plenty of sparkle. Neither are overly bright or dark, perfect for my tastes. 

IMAGING: the ananda has better separation, but the frequency distribution feels more random. The m1570 seems more cohesive all around. Image size and clarity are definitely better on the ananda. I‚Äôm always impressed by the image size the big egg planars present, and how easy it is to pick details out if the mix. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre sorta seeming to come from weird places at times, where the m1570 has everything placed as expected. 

SOUNDSTAGE: the ananda is taller, forward/rear depth is about the same, and the m1570 is actually wider. This makes the m1570 feel more 3d, and for lack of a better word, makes the ananda literally seem more ‚Äúplanar‚Äù. The lack of width in the ananda does make it feel more intimate and intense, especially with the larger images and great separation. But I find that I like the m1570 is better for gaming and cinema, and some genres of music. I love the ananda for psytrance since the sounds are are digital anyways, and it‚Äôs great to have them coming from all over the place in a really intense way. But the soundstage of the m1570 just seems more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù for soundtracks and analog music. 

DETAIL: both are about the same. As alluded to ananda is better but not by much. The details are easier to find on the ananda, but they‚Äôre all still there when you go looking in the 1570. 

OVERALL: the m1570 is great for the price. It‚Äôs my new daily driver. Better build quality than the ananda, though much heavier. I don‚Äôt mid the weight and think they‚Äôre fairly equal in terms of comfort. I still really enjoy the ananda, but closed back is a requirement for most of my listening at home and listening and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out at all with the m1570. It‚Äôs also gotten much better with time too so I now believe in burn-in.

1,"Found a Good DIY Solution to a Worn Out Headband Cushion After years of use the headband pad and earpads on my ath-msr7's were falling apart, the leather was slowly coming off in little flakes that would get on my ears and clothes. They still sound great so I wanted to get them replaced. New earpads are available online so I just got new ones, but the only thing I could find to buy online for the headpad was a tacky and bulky sleeve with a zipper to go over it. So I decided to mod it and I think it turned out much better than a sleeve would have.

&amp;#x200B;

[What ATH-msr7's look like new](https://preview.redd.it/viq1dndufka81.png?width=396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdb7256431892e724c7cf9a59eda45d59c7c813d)

First I cut off the cloth and leather covering the headband (it looked like the earpads do in the pic below), leaving the foam, wiring, etc. underneath in place.

&amp;#x200B;

[1. Leather and Cloth Cut Off](https://preview.redd.it/vqrffce2gka81.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78aa4c4639ff52d24a3c4fbaa1a217880d2bceab)

Second, since the headband was previously sealed with the leather/cloth covering I wanted to try and waterproof it a bit now that its removed. I wrapped headband in clingwrap and taped up the ends with scotch tape.

&amp;#x200B;

[2. Wrap headband in clingwrap and tape up the ends to protect the interior from water](https://preview.redd.it/q3o1tnepgka81.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35601ab11be079c03f44753bfec0a2ec8df37566)

Third, I took an old worn-out t-shirt, washed it, and cut a long piece of cloth from it (just going around the circumference of the shirt was long enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I wrapped the cloth around the headband tightly and just looping the end back into itself is secure enough to keep it on.

After ordering new earpads, here is the finished product:

So I have some Chinese earbuds (Artiste DC1), that I am pretty happy with.

I have been considering getting some wireless buds for the convenience, and possibly with noise cancelling too for flying.

However, I keep reading that I‚Äôll really notice a drop in sound quality, even if I spend a lot more.  Is this *actually* true, or just people scaremongering to justify their purchases?

Am I really to believe that going from some wired $25 earbuds to some Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus or Panasonic RZ-S500W at 4x the price, or even Sony WF-1000XM4 at 10x, wouldn‚Äôt come with a big step up in sound quality, or at least not be a step down?

I know price isn‚Äôt the only indicator of quality, and I‚Äôm not trying to start an argument, but given I can‚Äôt try earbuds before I buy I want to try to understand how much difference wireless *really* makes.

I sat down for the first time with these cans to really take in some music and noticed it felt like one ear was quieter than the other. I flipped them around and sure enough one did seem to be. So I went into fl studio and put to channels each with a basic sin and then hard panned them to each side, holding my phones with a decibel meter up to each earphone, and sure enough it seemed one was anywhere from 4-8db louder.

Vorbis = Very, Very bad handling of white noise sounds if the bitrate is 96 ~ 275kbps it just turns it into weird mess

1,"Stereo image narrower/wider depending on playback device? **Hey everyone, hope you're doing well!**

**Sennheiser HD600** listener here. Been observing a phenomon that has never been as clear and contrastful to me as now:

So far I've used an **M-Audio/Avid C400 USB audio interface** for listening and producing music on my computer systems. Sometimes I'd take my **Motorola Moto G4 smartphone** for couch moments.

When it comes to frequency response, loudness and soundstage I could never really complain about anything using these devices. For sure there are far better option to drive the HD600, but the experience has always felt neutral and very good for analyzing and enjoying mixes.

However, after christmas I decided to treat myself with a **new Audient ID14 MKII USB audio interface**

The moment I listened to my favorite music with it, I realized that through this new interface: 

1) the **stereo image** felt much **narrower than before**. 
2) On the other side, everything seemed **more clear** and **distinguishable**. Instrument positions/areas in the stereo field as well as frequencies were much **easier to pinpoint** than with the other devices.

Now I've been wondering what could be the cause of such a difference. I am yet not sure if I find the narrower soundstage to be better or worse.

Could it be related to stereo crosstalk or impedances?

Do you guys have any other clue?

1,"The price of things in Canada is disgusting. This is just a quit rant, I apologize if this shit is frowned upon here, but whatever. I just went on Amazon to buy a pair of KPH30i and Grado pads. The total came to 40 dollars. No problem! Sounds like a good deal to me! Then, as I'm checking out I realized Koss sent me to the U.S Amazon site. No problem, I head over to amazon.ca and see that the KPH30i are $60-66 instead of $29. I couldn't believe it so I browsed Amazon a bit more. No luck. Tried to find other websites that ship to Canada or are Canadian based. No luck. Finally, I say fuck it, let's see how much the pads cost with the headphones. $86 COMPARED TO $40.98 IN THE US. THIS IS BEFORE SHIPPING AND HANDLING. I understand that the dollar is different, but only by about 20 cents. I also understand that over the past 2 years, things have become pricier due to the pandemic, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Our groceries are insanely expensive, rent is impossible, and our minimum wage stays the same. This post will likely get taken down, but whatever. This is completely unfair. I'm supposed to pay nearly twice the price for cheap headphones simply because I live in Canada. And I know, I have it a lot better than the majority of people on Earth, there are probably billions of people who would die to be in my situation, but I still have the right to complain.

1,"Searching for headset, headphone for big head Hello everybody. 

I am searching for a Gaming Headset in the category ""big head"" and ""correction glasses"" friendly.

My head size is between 60-62 cm. I always have problems with headphones because the pressure on my head is to much. 

I like good audio quality so I bought a AKG Pro 275. It is definitely a game-changer. But, and this is a big but, the pressure on long time session ist just too much. It begins to hurt after a while.

Luckily, I was able to test the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 and the Steelseries Artic 9. 

First to the Beyerdynamic MMX 300. Despite that I always see reviews that are bragging about the build quality, I really have to say that I do not think they are exceptional. Especially in their price category. I have to say I was a little bit disappointed. On the other hand. The velour ear coffins are really nice. But overall the MMX 300 is on the more ""pressure"" side if I can say so. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being a lot of pressure and 1 being no pressure, they are a 6 to 7.

Then I was able to test the Steelseries Arctic 9. I am sure that the sound quality is less pleasurable I found them really nice to wear.  They had a ""loose fit"" style and, as far as I can say, on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being a lot of pressure and 1 being no pressure, they are a 2 or a 3. 

Sadly I do not like wireless and USB headphones. I had Sennheiser wireless headphones and they had a slight but noticeable irritable noise. I think native English speakers, would refer to ""background noise"" (german= Grundrauschen; swiss german=grundruuusch√§ .-)) 

So my categories are:   
\- Big head 

\- glasses friendly

\- wired (no USB, no wireless)

\- detachable micro (or just headphones and not headsets)

Do you have any other headphones, headset suggestions?

I really appreciate your help.

1,"Bluetooth headphone without the digital beeps or buzzes? I am on the lookout for a bluetooth headphone that doesn't have that obvious digital buzzing connection sound while it's connected. I have used the Philips shb3075 for years now but they seem to be less and less available so after mine died, I tried and bought a few different ones but they all seem to have that beeping and buzzing in the background while connected.

I went to a store where they sold a massive range of headphones but the guy had no idea what I meant with the digital background sound. He then went on a weird rant about older people (im in my 40's) always want to buy cheap headphones but expect high quality for a dime. Slightly weirded out by this passive aggressive remark, he adviced me a headphone that costed more than I was initially intended to spend but I was desperate for a good working headphone.

I returned it because surprise, surprise it had major bleeping and buzzing going on. My husband has trouble hearing that sound, but my daughter hears it as well. So I suspect my hearing is just in a bit higher range. (I read that woman can be more susceptible to hearing higher frequencies).

Wired isn't an option, sadly. I tried several different brands of headphones but they all makes that sound in the background. I am hoping that there is anyone here who picks up what my problem is and if there are any headphones out there that I'm able to listen to without those digital sounds in the background. Surely if the philips shb3075 (which used to be a cheap entry model even) was able to do it, there must be others?

Budget isn't much of an issue, but I wear it a lot while laying down as well, so it would be preferred if it isn't a very bulky one.

I also tried several of those expensive wireless in-ear phones, but I have quite a small posture and a tiny head so those in-ears are always way to big for me and I can't get them seated in my ear in a good way and also the battery charge of those is a tad short.

1,"Beating a dead horse. What are the worst stock headphone cables and why is the answer Hifiman? I have owned 40 +/- headphones (counting IEMs and ear buds). Most of them have been good, some of them amazing. Ever since owning models with a removable cable I have refused to buy any headphones without a removeable cable. So we are not talking about headphone cables that are not removeable, they are all disqualified. Also connector type is not really what this is about either. Some people love the HD800 connectors (who are these people?) and some hate them. Too many personal preferences here. 

 As for the included cables, I only tend to notice the cables if the are particularly bad or very good. I don't know how many people will agree on my favorite choice but I think most will be ready to 'beat a dead horse' when it comes to my nominees for worst stock cable. To be clear, I am not talking about sound. I do believe cables can have  A VERY SMALL IMPACT on sound, but that subject is also for another day. I am talking about functionality, build quality, feel, durability and aesthetics. 

The best **stock** cable I have ever used or touched is the new LCD-XC single ended cable (they also offer it balanced). It checks all of the boxes for me. Feels and looks durable. It has a nice simple color (all black). It never tangles or coils itself and has zero microphonics. 

I have three nominees. My first nominee is not too bad on first glance, but as we all know, looks are often deceiving. The E-MU Teak cables look very nice and the connectors are decent, but they are super fragile and microphonic. I have had to repair the solder on both 2.5mm ear cup connectors and the 3.5mm amplifier end as well. I now use Hart audio cables for these instead. Problem Solved. 

Nominee number one above used to be the only cable that I bitched about. Enter nominee number two, Hifiman 'medical tubing' cable. I had read about the cables, I had seen photos. I was still unprepared for how bad the Hifiman 'Medical tube' cables could actually be. When I opened the box I literally mumbled ""holy fuck"". The tubing actually looks like USED medical tubing. BONUS it also  feels like used medical tubing. It also has the cheapest looking connectors I have ever seen and the 3.5mm one is angled, WTF?  To the credit of this cable it has zero microphonics and coil memory. 

Nominee number three enters the room to a chorus of boos. The deceptively, not bad looking or feeling, Hifiman Arya cloth cable. This cable would be really decent if: 1- it came with $99 headphones, not $1600 headphones. 2- It did not have the memory of an Elephant and the microphonics of......well...a  lapel mic. This effing cable will literally stand up in a vertical coil on my desk and stay like that, for many hours. It is constantly twisting up and entering your line of site for no reason. It can never just hang out of the way. (Hart Audio Cables to the rescue again). I always forget about the annoying microphone capability of this cable because the memory issue is so dominant, but even without the memory issue, the micrphonics are a deal breaker here. To be fair- the cloth covering is not bad and it does feel extremely durable (like a Tonka Toy).

1,"ZMF Aeolus old vs new driver mesh seems to make a big difference! I was trying to diagnose a weird crinkling I was hearing on my secondhand Aeolus. ZMF support helped me fix it by taking off the pads and smoothing out the mesh that sits between the driver and pad, and informed me that they had changed the type of mesh used since my unit's date of manufacture (so only about a year ago).

I went to their site and bought the [new mesh](https://shop.zmfheadphones.com/collections/diy/products/acoustic-titan-mesh), and I just received and installed it today. Now, take this all with a grain of salt as I did absolutely 0 scientific testing and am far too lazy to swap the mesh back and forth to compare directly, but I swear my Aeolus sound better and clearer than before?

It would make a decent amount of sense too, as physically the old mesh was quite a bit denser and thicker than the new kind. So perhaps too much dampening was happening and muddying the sound?

Anyways, yeah I don't know if anyone has done more thorough/scientific testing on this, but I'd be interested to see how the different meshes compare in some measurements for sure. I assume there was some acoustic reasoning behind ZMF's decision to change up the mesh, anyways.",zmf aeolus old v driver mesh seems make big difference trying diagnose weird crinkling hearing secondhand aeolus zmf support helped fix taking pad smoothing mesh sits driver pad informed changed type mesh used since unit date manufacture year ago went site bought mesh shop zmfheadphones collection diy product acoustic titan mesh received installed today take grain salt absolutely scientific testing far lazy swap mesh back forth compare directly swear aeolus sound clearer make decent amount sense physically old mesh quite bit denser thicker kind perhaps much dampening happening muddying sound anyways yeah anyone done thorough scientific testing interested see different mesh compare measurement sure assume acoustic reasoning behind zmf decision change mesh anyways

1,"My experience producing music with the BeyerDynamic DT-1990 Pro Over the last few years, I've recreationally produced music, and will soon be releasing my first solo EP. Before I started producing, I used my Beyer's for everything - gaming, listening, general use - and always loved them. They sound fantastic, and have amazing detail, clarity, and airiness. However, my experience using them for producing has been less positive. 

I would make compositions that sounded great on these headphones, but when I listened to the mix on any of my other audio sources (M50x, car speakers, airpods, etc) it would sound muddy and oftentimes straight up bad. All of the subtle details and separation that was obvious on the DT 1990s would be totally lost on pretty much all other sources. After noticing this pattern, I made a few little beats while using my M50x's and the results were MUCH better. My mixes popped even more when I listened to them on the Beyers. What I learned was that if I could hear details on the M50x's, then they would be crystal clear and stand out on the Beyers (in a good way), and also sound good on other less-than-ideal sound systems.

1,"QCY HT03. Tremendous Value at Low Budget! **TLDR:** 
They are AirPods Pro-styled TWS earbuds with actually working ANC for about US$35. Basic sound quality with a neutral target.  Has a companion app (optional) &amp; both left+right bud can be used independently. No Multipoint, no wireless charging. Extremely good value for its asking price

**Basic Detail:**
QCY &amp; similar brands have been making TWS earbuds for quite a while now. At this point, it's disingenuous to call such products mere cheap clones or copies of the mainstream versions *(Apple AirPods/Sony WF-XMs/Jabra Elites/Samsung Galaxy Buds)* though those still exists.Rather, these days such products are catering to a price point not captured by the bigger brands. 

At this point in-time for the TWS market, ANC is increasingly becoming a baseline feature and QCY, with the HT03, has an insanely affordable model with said functionality for under US$50.

**Build Quality:**
It's plastic, it's glossy, it's basic. Feels like a cheap plastic toy in the hand. The upside is that they are extremely lightweight, feels even lighter than the OG AirPods in the ears.

The case is also made of a similar plastic quality. Looks, feels and operates cheaply. The lids will slam shut with gravity alone, no extra hinge mechanism to hold it further open. The magnets to pull in the buds are also passingly weak.

**App and Controls:**
The app is laughably bad with English localisation and seems to ask way too much permissions like Location for pairing and disabled battery optimization and an account login. The app will however still run even ignoring the permission requests and account creation though pairing for customization with the app might be more difficult.

However, the app makes it up more than it takes from the user by allowing individual customization for single, double &amp; triple taps for both earbuds. This is something the bigger brands don't even have as a standard feature. You also can just configure the controls once &amp; delete the app, the buds will save the configuration.

The touch controls are pretty lackluster though. It works, but there is no audio feedback for your taps, so no idea if your buds registered a single, double or triple tap; you just have to wait for the results to find out.

The short stem also means it's basically impossible to hold the buds without activating something. It's probably why by default, single-tap does nothing.

**Fit &amp; Sound Quality**
These buds have oval-style tips mimicking the AirPods Pro, but removing the tips reveal a standard nozzle instead of the AirPods Pro 'mini-speaker' type.

They accepted my standard Spinfit 1025s fine, though you might need to coax the eartips over the nozzle slightly harder than with other earbud models.

With my Spinfits + its extremely lightweight, they wear absolutely comfortably in my ear with a good-enough seal for some passive noise cancelling.

The sound quality is what you should expect for a US$40 pair. It won't provide the fullest soundstage, but it also doesn't overwhelmingly target a 'V-shaped' frequency response. The audio is actually quite balanced if not a bit muddy by default; this can be surprisingly alleviated alot by using Wavelet's AutoEQ, using the AirPods Pro as the target correction.

**ANC:**
Here's the real pudding. This actually works. It's not Sony levels of ANC, but it does tune out a lot of the more obvious ambient noise such as a ticking clock, appliance humming and the harsher pitches of a metro's rumbling; ANC isn't magic, it's not gonna silence a jackhammer or an low overhead aircraft. 

The HT03 ANC algorithm also appears to have a few seconds lag as it takes about that long for the effects to start after switching it on. So rapid changes in ambient sound isn't handled too well, but the attenuation effects are there

More surprisingly, its transparency/passthrough mode is about 70% as effective as Apple's version; it can sound metallic, but again it actually works &amp; it isn't just a suggestion of passthrough audio.

In all, you can be looking at 65 - 70% ANC of what you'd get from a more expensive pair for a way cheaper price.

**Ending comments:**
The HT03s are made to a price point, but QCY actually put the cost to where it actually matters the most, namely the ANC.

The whole physical product looks and feels cheap, but it didn't trade away size or weight nor did it offensively gimp the sound quality to pretend it delivers a fuller soundstage

It's not gonna beat out a proper pricey pair of ANC earbuds, but for about US$50 and you can find it for even less quite often, it's really gives tremendous value for what you're paying for.

I used to be big into headphones, even got a pair of HD800 (not S), before I realized speakers were more fun. I'm going to write these reviews in a likely offensive manner, mostly because I've been to What Hi-Fi and I cringe at everything ever written on that website.

  
Amplification was through my Macbook Pro 13. I played the same songs through Plex, most of which are FLAC, but let's be honest I'm not mastering any Grammy nominations here. My amplification level is out of 16. I don't listen to things loudly. Songs were:  


*(Interlude 1)* \- Alt-J: basically a cappella, just a test to see if it makes the weird harmonics in this song any weirder  


*Deadly Valentine* \- Charlotte Gainsbourg: a tough song since the mix is a bit congested in general, but sounds epic  


*Motherboard* \- Daft Punk: probably the best mixed song of the bunch. It tells you about the headphones, and you're way cooler for not using Get Lucky, even though you know it way better. Great test for imaging.  


*House of Glass* \- Holy Fuck: Listen to this song, it's excellent for testing transients and bass-to-mid frequencies, and also for getting off your tits.  


*Just the Same but Brand New* \- St. Vincent: Slightly recessed vocals, not the best mix for testing, but I know the song, and it's goes from quiet to loud.  


*Port of Call* \- Beirut: Know this song well, great acoustics, test for separation, and showing my general support for Zach Condon.  


It's a mix of songs that are well mastered, have different mixing strategies (a cappella vs orchestral, acoustic vs. electronic), and also songs I know well. I might add one or two more songs if I do this again, but right now, I know these songs well and cover a good spectrum. It's how I establish credibility before undermining that in basically a long meme.

**Sony ANC from 2005 (stock pads)**

Initial comments: These were the first pair of headphones I ever bought. I bought them at a college supply store for a summer camp in 2005, just after my sophomore year of high school. The ear pads were flaking like black dandruff so I swapped them for new ones, not OEM but close enough. They‚Äôre on ear with no ‚Äòcupping‚Äô (like Beats Solo 3, for example). So they‚Äôre going to be GOOD.

Comfort is bad, on ear, feel plastic hitting the ear. Also the headband is plastic and touches your head, but the ear pain doesn‚Äôt make you notice. Pre-Beats era though!

Amplification: 8/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Muffled, distortion on word ‚Äòthoughts‚Äô, overall not terrible for a piece of shit.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Weird clicking during the first chorus, narrow soundstage. Fortunately the song is better than the headphones.

String instruments sound recessed, almost like vocals are bussed to the same reverb. Whatever it is Sebasti√†n‚Äôs mixing is all for naught. Or nought. Whatever.

Oh forgot, the bass is there, but imprecise.

I‚Äôm hearing a synthesizer I haven‚Äôt heard on the right channel in the last chorus. Or is that distortion?

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

The imaging test! It fails.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Absolutely no separation, sounds like a compressor added. The transient test also fails. I have to mention at this point that some of the detail retrieval above the 1khz-ish region is surprising. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs bringing some things forward that shouldn‚Äôt be there, but still an interesting listen.

Treble around 1:40ish mark sounds artificially boosted, without sounding piercing.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Where are the mids. These headphones probably wouldn't handle a cappella at all, if you like listening to bad music

*Port of Call - Beirut*

Surprisingly handles this one well. It seems like voices + high or low instruments are fine, but only one of the three or all three becomes too much. 

It‚Äôs that time of the month, time to swap pads

**Sony ANC from 2005 (max pads)**

Conversion: used some fancy BrainWavz pads from amazon intense for over ear. They‚Äôre perforated. For whatever reason, there were also additional foam rings to put on the outside of the foam covering the driver. So it was like filling a donut with a donut hole, so to speak. I mainly did this because the max pads were a little loose feeling, and I figured it would put some space between my ears and the foam glued to the driver grill. Comfort on the ears is way higher, but now the headband (which has no padding and is just plastic) is more noticeable.

Amplification: 12/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Lol this sounds worse? Voices are a little nasally now. Imaging doesn‚Äôt seem any better. Then again, this is my Glee track for people that like music.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Bass initially seems better, deeper, and separated from mids. There isn‚Äôt much extension, but compared to ‚Äòfull mixes‚Äô in the last test this could be worse. Piano jam in between verse and chorus sounds weird, almost like it‚Äôs undergoing a slow phaser. Chorus just hit, soundstage is much better. Who knew putting distance between your ears and the driver was good. Besides people that make on-ear headphones.

Going back to the start, the filtered-swept oscillator in the verse is really present. I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs a treble spike somewhere around 8kHz.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

The water drop percussive sound is really weird. At least it‚Äôs separate from the rest of the mix. Have the say the bass is acceptable now, I‚Äôd say ‚Äòaccurate‚Äô in terms of amount and separation for a closed back headphone. For something I refuse to trash it‚Äôs doing well.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Lol treble is pretty bad. Bass is a lot more fun. It still fails the transient test, but I‚Äôm having while it does.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Sometimes I feel like these headphones have an auto-karaoke effect where the vocals disappear. Maybe it‚Äôs got built-in Izotope frequency editor. Drum break sounds good.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Again transients aren‚Äôt brilliant, but it could be worse. During main arpeggio (goes throughout the song) there‚Äôs a honkiness that‚Äôs somehow not part of the actually brass instruments. 

Considering these headphones came out when N\*Sync were still popular, I think they‚Äôre good enough for bad music.

**Phillips Running Headphones**

Comfort: I can feel the seam where the silicon was pressed scraping my right ear. 

Amplification: 4/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Lol these aren‚Äôt terrible. It‚Äôs a bit echoey, which I think is a result of the tip design. They‚Äôre earbuds, not IEMs. Still, I‚Äôve heard worse.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

The low-pass filtered beginning sounds‚Ä¶ more filtered.

Oddly high amount of separation, but I think it‚Äôs really just the wonky frequency response creating artificial divisions. Or maybe it‚Äôs really not that bad? 

On further review, penalty stands: mids are muffled, and not because there‚Äôs too much bass. Or maybe there is, and it‚Äôs just not reaching my ear. The pianos are so present it‚Äôs actually a nice listen, unless you like anything else in your music.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Surprisingly competent. Remember some of these songs are better mixed than others, so they‚Äôll sound great (as far as being a song goes, not revealing the flaws of your source) regardless of how you listen to them.

Treble is also recessed in a strange way‚Ä¶ percussive sounds in the higher frequencies are muted. Better than shrill. Or maybe I‚Äôm better off just not listening to music.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Lol the mids are so congested. I feel like there‚Äôs a 3 band EQ, and it artificially boosts something in the low end, the mid range, and the high end. Everything in between is lost.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

The guitar picking sounds nice. I‚Äôm sure she used these running buds when recording.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

It sounds like he took a few sniffs of helium, wtf is this upper mid range treble. 

*Overall*: I would say they‚Äôre fining for running, but the fit is poor and the silicone rubber tips are better used for cleaning deadskin off your feet.

**Turkish Airlines Earbuds**

Comfort: Not bad, they fit quite snugly. Cables are super cheap and thin, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre 1 strand of conducive material. If you care about blue earbuds and only care about the color and nothing else, these might be for you.

Amplification: 5

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Are these earbuds or metal cans with string in between. There‚Äôs a weird resonance after the echo‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs quite shrill the second I turn the volume up since I can‚Äôt hear much.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

No bass, no mids, no highs. I can basically make out the snare. Instrument separation is the best I‚Äôve ever heard, namely because it sounds like the instruments were separated from the track and I‚Äôm listening to the wet signal of the reverb at end of signal chain.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

These headphones are a great way to simulate being underwater while listening to music you care about.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Weirdly the bass is still there are the beginning, and the hi hats/drums overall somehow make it through. I was going to say it‚Äôs the least affected song, but there are quiet parts that resonate and pierce my eardrums.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

At this point these headphones are only good at providing a stereo image, in that you hear the shit version of what you were trying to listen to in each ear separately.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Git Gud Turkish Airlines

*Overall:* Pretty bad, I‚Äôd rather quit listening to recordings of anything than use these again. I think I could turn them into an interested effect pedal by sending signal in, recording output. 

**1More Triple Driver**

Have had these for about 5 years, should replace the tips but decided to buy new headphones instead. ‚ÄôTis the /r/headphones way.

No removable plug is a screw, but at least there‚Äôs a built-in mic. This is basically an upgrade to Apple Earbuds pre-AirPods.

Amplification: 4/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Listening to this after the Turkish Airlines Air Pods, it sounded good enough. Mid sounded somewhat relaxed.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

I forgot how good this song was after the Turkish Airlines incident. Now that I‚Äôm acclimated to hearing music again, everything sounds very good, but I can tell there are some details missing. 

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Instrument separation isn‚Äôt great, but it‚Äôs a superb recording. Now noticing the lack of subs around the 3:13ish mark.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Good texture to the bass. Also transients are nice.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Treble seems accurate, bass is rich (not a ton of low end extension in this song), but mids are recessed. Better headphones for rock/electronic/high action music.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Oddly seems better than St. Vincent in terms of hearing vocals. The song makes up for inadequacies in the headphones.

Depending on your weeb level the lack of waifus may be off-putting. These might as well have been Sennheiser Orpheus compared to Turkish Airlines. I know people say V-shaped and whatever, but it‚Äôs not surprising to see why people still recommend them. Plus, there are no anime titties, so you can wear them at work or in public.

**Drop/JVC HD-FXA1 Dual Carbon**

Build quality is great, packaging is great, the leather case peels super easily (I haven‚Äôt taken them anywhere and they‚Äôre showing wear). Comfort is good initially, but they are seemingly heavy.

Amplification: 4/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Only thing missing seems to be spaciousness of regular headphones. All the weirdness of the duo vocals is totally there.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Great bass extension, great separation, only thing missing is basically soundstage. Kickdrum is so good in this, especially when you really get a good seal.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Transients are excellent, texture in the treble is the best I‚Äôve heard so far. Kick drum has tons of impact and a tiny bit of boominess.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Really good test of how good these are at detail. Low end is super nice. Treble starting to pierce a little bit.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Vocals sound a little recessed, but that‚Äôs because there isn‚Äôt much separation between that and the other instruments. I should mention by now the vocals in this track are recorded to be a little in the background, not front and center throughout.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Not much to comment on. The outro can easily get congested here and doesn‚Äôt.

These sound amazing, but that weight is killer. I can‚Äôt imagine you get much better than this regardless of how much more you spend.

**Etymotic XRSR4 extra bass etc**

Comfort and Build: I think this is where I start to make sex jokes. The best tips (though they‚Äôre so long you‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs not ‚Äòjust the tip‚Äô) are the anal bead ones, with three sets of ‚Äòribs‚Äô to close up the leakage. Jesus Christ I‚Äôm about to pass out from the possible jokes. In any case, it is weird for maybe an hour or two, but you get used to it. The thing you‚Äôre always conscious of after the fact is the feeling that your head is pressurized. They are super lightweight, and I bought them to compete with the JVC‚Äôs. If not for weight, I think JVC would win, but these are still excellent.

Packaging is good, cable has some slight microphonic above Y split. 

Amplification: 5/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Seems accurate, and good detail retrieval. I can hear the reverb well on these.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Things sound a little congested with the bass synth in the chorus. Again, detail retrieval is excellent. Imaging is solid considering there‚Äôs a lot going on this song. Bass is present and seems good, but doesn‚Äôt get you hyped. 

Note: that synth in the right channel I mentioned during the Sony ANC stock ‚Äòreview‚Äô is back! Sounds like it‚Äôs bitcrushed square wave with a HPF. These earbuds are so good it validates shitty ones!

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Imaging is a lot better, but also the mix is different than Deadly Valentine. Everything sounds really effortless. You can tell the bass rolls off a bit, but it‚Äôs all pleasant. 

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Lots of energy, lots of detail, great transients. The more subtle elements of a very sound song become apparent. I haven‚Äôt heard this song since I got these headphones, I‚Äôm hyped like the first time I heard the record.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

The narrow soundstage doesn‚Äôt do the mids any favors, but the details are excellent.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Great instrument separation in this one, you can really hear the dynamics of the strings being strummed. The slightly recessed mids make the build up toward the end less impactful. Nitpicking, just because it looks like I‚Äôm gushing over my Etyrotics. 

Overall: I keep talking about how detailed these are, and now I want to try them against the JVC‚Äôs again. Or not. These are awesome earbuds with tips for all your kinks.

**V-Moda Crossfade Wireless fancy apt-x version**

I‚Äôve had these for about 4 years and used them tons. V-shaped response, overall quite comfortable. I installed the XL pads a while back.

Amplification Notes: set at 5 on wired, set at 7 on wireless. I‚Äôve always thought the bluetooth amplification was better than whatever built-in one I‚Äôve had, such as phones, laptops, etc. It almost sounds like there‚Äôs more detail with the Bluetooth, but it‚Äôs very slight and hard to AB.

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

You can tell it‚Äôs a bit recessed, especially after the Etymotics. Still, it sounds nice and I don‚Äôt hear any obvious dips. Also, it‚Äôs nice to wear over-ears again.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Treble on percussion seems recessed, it‚Äôs a very dark sound; mids are recessed but it‚Äôs not V-shaped. It‚Äôs also not the same as Beats where you straight up don‚Äôt hear anything outside bass, which seems tight.

I used to own the M-100s (wired), and when I compared them, the M-100 seemed to have more bass impact. That‚Äôs why these ‚Äòfeel‚Äô a bit more natural.

The magical hidden synth is there, but I have to concentrate a bit more.

It‚Äôs weird, the mids and treble aren‚Äôt that present but the soundstage and imaging are way more believable. That‚Äôs over-ears vs. IEMs for you.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Everything sounds natural, even on bass heavy headphones like this everything makes it through the mix. Seriously, if you‚Äôre on the fence about a pair of headphones but want to keep them, listen to this song.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Sometimes this song seems like it was made for these headphones. Tons of fun, not as detailed as the Etymotics, but even more hyped.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

Vocals are surprisingly solid for an acoustic song. The other mid-centric instruments do get a bit lost.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

I think What Hi Fi would say ‚Äògood energy‚Äô in the pros and ‚Äòflatulence in the temporal arrhythmia‚Äô in the cons column. 

Overall: It‚Äôs v-shaped, it‚Äôs v-named, it‚Äôs bluetooth, it‚Äôs built like a tank. You can get custom Waifu prints on the side to match your Moondrops. It‚Äôs not really a reference pair of headphones, but if you like music you‚Äôll like these. If you don‚Äôt like music these won‚Äôt help.

**AKG K712 Pro**

Comfort and build: Very comfortable, though I wish the cups were a little bigger and/or deeper. The mini XLR connector is annoying and stupid. You basically have to use them with a Modmic for gaming or DIY a 3.5mm jack. If they weren‚Äôt fancy and came with two mini-XLR cables I‚Äôd swap them. Also the non-coiled cable is annoyingly long. 

Amplification: 8/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Yeah these are pretty much reference headphones. I‚Äôm betting nicer amplification (i.e. Schiit Magni) would help with the dynamic range. 

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Here we hear some bass. The mid-bass region has good transients, can hear the resonance on the bass synth in the initial verse. In the main chorus it has that excellent sense of faking speakers. For some it‚Äôs unnatural, which I understand, but I‚Äôve always been a fan of that. 

Bonus: hidden synth in the right channel isn‚Äôt that noticeable. 

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

The ‚Äòteardrop‚Äô percussion sounds so full, the mid through the highs. I mean it‚Äôs a perfectly mixed song on reference headphones.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

It‚Äôs now when you notice the issue with bass on open-back dynamic headphones. The song compensates for the sobriety.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

This song isn‚Äôt as well mixed seemingly. Still, the ethereal elements are all there. I think these headphones are in a sense boring, which means you can easily just get lost in the song rather than listening for issues with the source.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Instrument separation: check. Sense of fate: double check. I will say the mids and bass seem to overlap a bit in the outro/exposition with the bass drum and the horns.

Overall: We all know this is the point of diminishing returns, especially when you buy these used, which I did. I wish the soundstage were a wee bit bigger. The only headphones I‚Äôve had before that I remember being ‚Äòbetter‚Äô would be Sennheiser HD800/S. These seem less fragile, though that‚Äôs likely bias from price tag difference. If anyone wants to test 

**Audio Technica AD900x**

Build and Comfort: The wing design works for me, the only issue is if it gets off balance the cups can price down on my ears (from the top). I just have to make sure it‚Äôs well adjusted every 20 minutes or so.

I DIY‚Äôd them to have a removable jack. 

I‚Äôve had these on and off for close to 10 years now. They‚Äôre typically my gaming headset but they were also my first legit headphones, so in a sense they‚Äôre a reference pair for me. I‚Äôm romantic about them, maybe I am a weeb.

Amplification: 5/16

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Artificial imaging and sounds awesome.

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

So you might have heard these have no bass. They don‚Äôt extend deep, but there does seem to be a slight boost in the midbass. It‚Äôs satisfying without listening too loudly.

The hidden synth is back! Probably the best of the bunch.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Absolutely filthy. Sounds so good, really feels like a set of speakers in a big room. The bass is satisfying because of the attack/decay of the kick drum and bass combo. The outro sounds particularly good.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

The bass is full, but something feels like it‚Äôs missing. It doesn‚Äôt sound as crunchy in the obnoxious part. Still, I could still be flying Turkish Airlines. Details (treble transients) could be better.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

I thought it was always weebs trying to impose their love of female vocals, but yeah, the correct frequencies are brought forth. I‚Äôm realizing these are like Grados for people who value fidelity. Bass is nice too.

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

I heard this song on these headphones back in the day, and I‚Äôd listen to it on repeat. Still feels the same, which says a lot about the song, and a lot about the headphones. 

And the fact that I said that says a lot about me.

**BONUS: Audeze Penrose X**

Since I‚Äôm now a shill that‚Äôs deleted his post for more upvotes on the second go, I have a pair of Penroses that I need to return. Initial impressions: Bluetooth isn‚Äôt brilliant, and you need to update firmware, otherwise you keep hearing ‚Äòconnected‚Äô while the dongle is plugged into another device (in my case, an Xbox). There is a ton of hiss on the right channel when nothing is playing. There‚Äôs a slight hiss in the V-Modas too, but this is unacceptable.

The controls are odd. I don‚Äôt know why they had an encoder vs. a regular attenuator with hard stops. That means when you adjust volume on the microphone or headset to the maximum or minimum there are no hard stops. You‚Äôll keep scrolling the wheel after you‚Äôve hit max.

Comfort isn‚Äôt great. After about 30 minutes I can feel the top pressing into my head. I wish the headband had been deeper. I don‚Äôt have issues with my V-Modas, and the K712s do press against my head, just not this much. Clamping is fine.

Amplification: 4/16. Using Bluetooth this time because not sure the MBP has enough juice for planars.

*(Interlude 1) - Alt-J*

Tons of detail. The decay in the reverb is more apparent. There‚Äôs a nice heft to some of the lower-mid/upper-bass notes. 

*Deadly Valentine - Charlotte Gainsbourg*

Ah, planar bass, the reason I bought these headphones. Great transients in the low end, far exceeding the rest. For a track that‚Äôs a little congested these headphones don‚Äôt do much extra, except add campy aesthetics. Considering the only people wearing these are sweats in their bedrooms I‚Äôm surprised they even bothered to soup up the Mobius to look worse.

Some aspects of treble are more in your face, without getting too shrill. Hidden right channel synth is present at the end. These are probably the most fun headphones for this song.

*Motherboard - Daft Punk*

Something seems not quite as bright in the upper mid/lower-treble. You can tell the decay on the bass is way tighter than the dynamics. There isn‚Äôt more than the V-Modas, so if your‚Äôe looking for a pair of headphones that can do double duty for looking like a gamer and getting a nice FR for music, look no further.

*House of Glass - Holy Fuck*

Almost like being in a field with the drummer. Transients are so good. The soundstage isn‚Äôt massive, but if something is panned hard you hear it. 

The spike in the treble is back. It‚Äôs a bit much, and at times seem ‚Äòcrunchy‚Äô. And not in the Ronald Jenkees way.

*Just the Same But Brand New - St. Vincent*

The vocals are more present than they‚Äôve been in the other headphones. Imaging is still really nice, these headphones work well with this song. 

*Port of Call - Beirut* 

Again, details are great, especially in the treble. I‚Äôd say these are in line with the AKG‚Äôs but just a planar, closed back version. The soundstage isn‚Äôt as wide as them, but it all seems pretty believable. You do still get the sense that you‚Äôre listening through headphones.

Overall: After listening to music closely I almost want to keep them. However the silent Bluetooth hiss is super annoying, and I do think Audeze should offer these as open-backs.  Then they‚Äôd be better for gaming by reducing some of the bass (which is over the top in the games I play) and increasing the soundstage width, and they‚Äôd also have to eliminate the hideous print on the cups. Also the headband isn't brilliant. I'd need to crochet a lime green and black headband cover to make them work.

1,"KZ ZEX Pro (x Crinacle) Review. They tried I don‚Äôt really know much about cheap headphones, and I feel it‚Äôs important to admit it right away. Well, it‚Äôs not that I know nothing about cheap *Chinese*¬†ones, but I‚Äôve only heard the names of some manufacturing companies.

But when the KZ ZEX Pro (aka KZ x Crinacle CRN) came out, I got curious: Crinacle being mostly engaged in headphones measuring and analyzing, together with KZ produces a hybrid model with neutral tuning, and all that for around $30. The headphones motto says ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt need to pay for tuning‚Äô: that is, the right tuning is available for any, even small money.

So I rushed to AliExpress and ordered these.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ch0ecedid9a81.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616fbca440d020a1392319ebb24170fa54f16729

#  What‚Äôs included &amp; specifications

The headphones come in a very simple rather small box. There are a 2-pin (0.75 mm) cable with a 3.5 jack and three pairs of earpads inside. Headphones‚Äô technical specs:

* Design: in-ear closed-back.
* Drivers: 1 dynamic, 1 armature, 1 electret.
* Impedance: 25 Ohms.
* Sensitivity: 104 dB.
* Weight of a single earpiece: 7 grams.

## Ergonomics and manufacturing quality

The headphones are made of glossy transparent plastic, the shell is opaque matte (black and gold versions available). As for the fit, it‚Äôs an ambiguous experience: those ‚Äòwings‚Äô protruding from the enclosure put a lot of pressure on my ears.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkxs8pdld9a81.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28357977c0a30000e080b1419b1f14ec54adb475

Moreover, these wings have nothing inside (I mean, these don‚Äôt cover anything electronic), that is, the manufacturer made these appendices on purpose ‚Äî for better ergonomics (thanks a lot). Well, I believe that it‚Äôs just my ears, since the rest of the enclosures fit inside the auricle and the auditory canal quite comfortably.

The headphones are simple, but neat. The sound ducts are even protected by mesh.

# Measurements and sounding

*The measurements were performed on a modified miniDSP EARS measuring stand calibrated to the IEF target curve for in-ear headphones. The headphones measurements corresponding to the target IEF curve should look like a flat curve in my graphs. For each of the earpieces, the measurements were made until 5 reliable and stable measurements were obtained for the left and right channels; any deviant measurement results were excluded. The resulting measurements were obtained by averaging the responses of two channels, that is, ten measurements in total were taken into account. All diagrams shown feature 1/12 octave smoothing. As always, for the info about rigs, graphs and headphones measurements refer to my article.*

The frequency response of the KZ ZEX Pro normalized relative to the IEF curve¬† looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/140a1i9wd9a81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7540d5aa9fbcba4d36666eb5641c7a884f40750

 Let‚Äôs see what it says:

* The lower-frequency range is configured in an extremely neutral manner as for in-ear headphones. The sub-bass doesn‚Äôt interfere with the bass, and the rise reaches its maximum at the very bottom ‚Äî at 20 Hz. Hence, while listening to some music (with the right earpads, of course), the bass seems to be fast, somewhat whipping.
* The middle section is completely flat, except for some small rises at 2 and 3 kHz.
* The upper frequencies are‚Ä¶ well, pretty odd. There‚Äôs a peak at 8 kHz (+8 dB), then a sharp dip at 10‚àí16 kHz, reaching -21 dB at its minimum.

Aaand just in case you didn‚Äôt know, such a tuning removes all the ‚Äòairness‚Äô, all after-sounds, that sounds of the singer‚Äôs breathing, as well as the upper-frequency section of cymbals, saxophone, violin, etc. from any recording like COMPLETELY. That being said, there are a quite collected and detailed bass, wonderful analytical middle frequencies, but right after those there are those sharp and shrilling sibilants due to the ‚Äòhump‚Äô at 8 kHz, and then just an endless silent pit. I mean, the headphones sound sibilative, but dull at the same time: as if your ears are stuffed. I don‚Äôt even know how it can be better described. Needless to say, due to this dip after 10 kHz, the feeling of the volume of the imaginary sound stage is radically reduced.

Hoping to assess the sounding from a subjective perspective, I tried the ZEX Pro with various music genres, from minimalistic to jazz of the 50s, from EBM to Schnittke, from reggaeton to Bulgarian folk songs. What was it like? Well, you can listen to some not too energetic electronic tracks for sure without losing your mind, given that you don‚Äôt really know how it actually should sound, that is, without any actual music instruments or references to check on. Then yes, it would be somewhere around okayish.

I also tried to equalize the sound (using ADI-2 DAC), and it turned out that you actually can fix the sound:

https://preview.redd.it/erqvk7dyd9a81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde15a37125956a8e916d41d43ff41fbea0951c8

 But, firstly, the 10‚àí16 kHz dip still remains at -10 dB, and that‚Äôs still a lot. And, secondly, the unpleasant sharp squeaky hint doesn‚Äôt go away, no matter how hard you fiddle the equalizer. Maybe it‚Äôs all about that electret driver the manufacturer used to take care of the upper frequencies and to save on at the same time, and this same driver is actually doing good, I don‚Äôt know.

To be honest, I‚Äôm not surprised by the generally bad sounding of these headphones, because $30 is $30, after all. What I just can‚Äôt understand are the usage scenarios. Like, okay, use it with an equalizer. Alright, which one to use, since smartphones don‚Äôt feature analog audio jacks anymore? The one in a DAP or in a PC/laptop, of course! The question is, why would you buy $30 headphones while having a separate DAP? Would you really connect such headphones to a PC or laptop and why? And the trickiest question is where can you get a functional equalizer capable of pulling the frequencies up by +/-20 dB?

Questions, questions everywhere.

Like I‚Äôve already mentioned, I don‚Äôt know much about headphones with such a price tag. But I still wanted to compare the ZEX Pro with something very affordable. The only qualifying model I could pick is the AKG EO‚ÄìIG955 headphones. Wait with the googling, these are just the headphones (the headset, to be precise) for the Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone. At the moment, these are no longer available to buy at stores, but are still there to buy from individuals in excellent condition for around $8. When the S10 was released, the headset was on sale separately and cost some $40. Long story short, I grabbed the headset, did the measurements and compared those with the ZEX Pro ones:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m6wxhsg0e9a81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ed3a6a5fa5849f6d31d70ad9e903511d8870f8

Despite the clear V-shaped frequency response and the huge peak at 14 kHz, the EO-IG955 sounds much more harmonious and pleasant than the ZEX Pro. Not more correct, just more pleasant. But even I, being a big fan of ‚Äòsmooth‚Äô headphones sounding and sound delivery close to the original creator‚Äôs idea, wouldn‚Äôt think for a second as what to choose between the two. The EO-IG955 model obviously wins. Don‚Äôt get me wrong here: it‚Äôs not that the EO-IG955 are good headphones, it‚Äôs that the ZEX Pro are even worse.  

## Summary

As far as I can tell, when trying to adjust the frequency response of headphones worth $30, be ready for a lot of technical limitations. And if the headphones in question are a 3 different types of drivers mode, then there will probably be even more limitations. Therefore, here‚Äôs my conclusion: the $30 worth in-ear headphones just can‚Äôt be good. I mean, it‚Äôs the big and established Crinacle ‚àí and he couldn‚Äôt do any better for such money, so no, you wouldn‚Äôt find anything decent at all. Of course, there are still tons of listings of second-hand headphones, but if you want something new or in ‚Äòas new‚Äô condition‚Ä¶

Therefore, a separate question arises around the Crinacle‚Äôs statement ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt need to pay for tuning‚Äô ([source](https://crinacle.com/2021/12/20/behind-the-scenes-kz-x-crinacle-crn-zex-pro/)):

https://preview.redd.it/prm9wof5e9a81.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1146bcf729a4cc25842e2923a42a0e1df4c8035b

As far as I understand, if it actually was technologically possible, the tuning would be different ‚Äî the measurements of the best ([according to Crinacle himself](https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/)) in-ear headphones look somewhat different, especially after 10 kHz. That is, something tells me that if the frequency response is actually the main spec of any headphones, then we do pay for tuning. But the tuning ‚Äî if not neutral, then at least digestible over the entire audible frequency range ‚Äî is a serious technological problem that is being solved only in relatively expensive models.

OR we‚Äôre dealing with some sort of conspiracy between manufacturers.

And as for the KZ ZEX Pro in question, it just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt work out. These are just bad cheap headphones, that‚Äôs all. But I think it‚Äôs not because someone didn‚Äôt try hard enough or deliberately chose the wrong frequency response configuration (perhaps the Crinacle is the last person to consciously opt for such a tuning), but because at the current stage of technological progress any decent headphones with neutral sounding for such money are simply impossible to create.

In fact, my thought is that it‚Äôs not even about the fact of the release of these headphones itself, but the ongoing process of cooperation between a competent reviewer and the manufacturer. And I believe that sooner or later they just must produce something decent.

1,"What's your post-purchase disappointment? For me, it has to be the Sivga SV021 (aka Robin) for tuning reasons. Before making the purchase I wanted a closed back headphone that is comfortable, fun sounding, and well constructed for my budget at the time.   


On my first listen I was impressed with the soundstage and detail these had, but that impression was soon ruined the more music I listened to. For context, I listen to a large selection of genres that I probably won't be able to list. Simply, the bass is too damn loud and bloated (like 5 decibels over my limit), the mids are ""borked"" and shouty, and the treble is seemingly uncontrolled. I did not buy this for the mids, but they are pretty bad whenever the mids happen imo. I've used EQ for a more harman neutral tuning for about a week and even then the SV021 just didn't hold up to my standards anymore. And I really dislike dealing with EQ when the one priority I have is to get a headphone that will not \*require\* EQ as I switch headphones multiple times a day, unfortunately I failed myself in that headphone choice. The only redeeming values are the comfort and build quality, very good for a $150 can. A shame that the V-shaped tuning was grossly overcooked.   


Going to replace this with a significant upgrade later down the line, I might get a $500 open back and then a KZ CRN or something. I do not need suggestions from this sub, but you can DM me if you feel like it.  


I would like to know what your own post-purchase disappointment has been in the hobby. And for those SV021 owners, I do not want to give you chronic buyer's remorse but I would like to know your opinions on the SV021.

1,"Neutral 20-Band EQ Setting for Sony WH-1000XM3 (works with LDAC) Hi! I've had the WH-1000XM3 for more than 2 years now and I found its bass overly emphasised, to the point where the vocals sound a bit veiled. I've tried using the AutoEQ settings on Wavelet and also other recommended EQ profiles, but I decided to create my own EQ profile in the end.


I'm using the 20-band equaliser in Equalizer Buddy, an Android app which is free on the play store (no affiliation to me btw).


I'll share it here if any of you would like to try it¬† 

(I was aiming for a more balanced and neutral EQ tuning)

Pre-amp: -3 db 

Hz:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† db 

31:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -3.09 

44:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -3.13 

63:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -2.9 

88:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -2.38 

125:¬† ¬† ¬† -3.24 

177:¬† ¬† ¬† -1.71 

250:¬† ¬† ¬† -1.43 

354:¬† ¬† ¬† -0.7 

500:¬† ¬† ¬† 0.44 

707:¬† ¬† ¬† 1.26 

1k:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 1.26 

1.4k:¬† ¬†¬† -0.52 

2k:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -3.64 

2.8k:¬† ¬†¬† -1.61 

4k:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -0.81 

5.7k:¬† ¬†¬† -1.63 

8k:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -0.61 

11.3k:¬†¬† -1.18 

16k:¬† ¬† ¬† -0.4 

21.6k:¬†¬† 0.13

Alternatively if you do not have a pre-amp setting, you can simply reduce the loudness of all the frequencies further by 3db. 


You can also watch my video on YouTube for more info on why I adjusted certain frequencies too:

1,"Have you ever felt a lack of power while driving IEMS? I was having some fitment issues on my Tin T3, and recently got some CP 360 - S for it. The fit was great. I've been listening to them on a BT DAC (Ugreen 80895 - CS43131), and I was finding the performance very underwhelming. Soundstage pretty much disappeared, and the sound felt very unengaging. I was thinking, is it because of the new ear tips? Was feeling super disappointed. The DAC runs my other IEMs fine, never had issues with my other ones (blons, some kzs, quarks etc).

  
So, today I plugged them to my V40, and I was speechless at the difference. Very, very noticeable. The soundstage was good, and the sound was immensely better. I tried them on my sonata hd, and the sound was still comparable to my V40, infinitely better than the other BT DAC (even when run wired).  

&amp;#x200B;

After this experience, I am convinced that some power, does help some IEMs sound better. Maybe not all of them, but some do benefit from power. The difference was absolutely noticeable. I know, low impedance, high efficiency, tiny drivers - but my ears say otherwise. I am actually convinced now to get something like a Fiio K3 or K5 Pro, whether it's for my IEMs or the Sennheiser HD 560s that's on its way. Did you guys have any experience like this? I'm curious to hear.

1,"My experience with YOWU so far and why I don't recommend I don't know if anyone is looking for an honest, unbiased YOWU review but I wanted to give mine just in case.   


About 8 months ago my partner bought me the YOWU 3S wireless headphones. The packaging was cute, they came in a travel case which could be handy if you needed it. This was the first time I'd used wireless headphones, of any kind so I had no clue what to expect or what was normal. Initially, I wasn't aware that using bluetooth headphones with the mic would make the sound quality poor and it wasn't recommended for gaming--this was on me for not doing my research, so really while playing with friends I was limited to using the headphones while they were plugged in. I guess this is something to consider if you were planning on getting one and didn't know also. The sound quality was similar to my Razer Kraken I had owned before, but slightly worse. If you weren't able to compare the two you wouldn't notice. The mic quality is quite terrible, to be honest, but I'm not sure what you could expect from a headset with a built in mic. I think I expected slightly better for the price though. They are RGB, but with only a few settings to control on the headset themselves. They don't have a desktop app so you need to connect the headset to your phone first, download the app, sync them to your phone, choose the custom colour (and sound setting if you like) and then reconnect to your pc. This is kind of a hassle considering every time the headphones turn off they reset to their original colour anyway, so it seems a bit tedious. The phone app has a ""YOWU radio"" that plays music though, so that's cute I guess.  


I was really basking in the bluetooth capabilities for a couple of weeks until I realised the battery life was only a couple of hours (despite the fact that they advertise 48 hours. I literally only just found this out while writing this and had a laugh because this definitely isn't the case for mine, whether its a fault or not I'm unsure). I'm assuming this was standard for bluetooth headphones, but it meant I needed to start using them while they were plugged in for long gaming sessions. Unfortunately, the usb c supplied with the headphones would constantly fall out while I was playing, literally just come loose and then drop, while I was using them. Even if it wasn't falling out entirely, it coming loose disconnected it regardless, so slight movements of my head would cut out all audio and disconnect the headset from my pc. I thought maybe it was just the type of plug and this was common until I realised that I never had this issue with similar usb c devices like my switch or a phone. It took me, admittedly, several months to realise that my headphone plug literally falling out mid-game wasn't normal for a $200AUD headset, so by this time I had owned them for several months already. I decided to contact YOWU and this is when I realised how terrible their customer service is as everyone talks about.  


Initially, it took only a couple of hours to hear back from them. I told them about the issue, they asked me to test it with other usb c plugs, which I did, and it had the same result; coming loose and falling out. We went through a few other troubleshooting options. Maybe it was just me, but as it came closer to them admitting it was their responsibility and they realised they could no longer guide me to helping me sort it out on my own, their responses took weeks, and then months to get back to me. I would have to message their instagram account and complain before getting a reply via email again. This is when I found out YOWU don't even offer warranty of any kind. Fine for a small company, but for headphones with pricing up there of big brands I'm very surprised they don't assume any responsibility considering faults seem to be quite common with YOWU, and the lack of warranty is never clearly, blatantly stated. Since being in contact with them over the last couple of months, the headphones have only gotten worse. I'm not sure if it's related to them constantly being disconnected and reconnected, but I've had issues with the microphone not being recognised, the bluetooth not connecting correctly, sound issues and more. More issues I had with any other headset in my entire life.  


They so far have surprisingly offered to repair the headset, assuming I send it back to them but have demanded I pay for shipping. I don't think I'm enjoying the headset enough to pay another $40 for shipping  which is almost 1/4 of the price of the headphones themselves. After I kindly requested they pay for the return costs, it's been about two weeks since I've heard from them. I've heard others have the same issue with them demanding you pay for shipping but they eventually come around. I'm hoping this happens here. I'm not really sure where the experience is going to end up but considering I owned my Razer Kraken for several years and had nothing but compliments for it, and they were the same price, and so far the YOWU 3S has just been a plethora of issues, I would advise anyone with low patience for roundabout customer service and poor quality to steer clear of YOWU.",experience yowu far recommend anyone honest unbiased yowu review wanted give mine case month ago partner bought yowu wireless headphone packaging cute came travel case could handy needed first time used wireless headphone kind clue expect normal initially aware using bluetooth headphone mic make sound quality poor recommended gaming research playing friend limited using headphone plugged guess something consider planning getting sound quality similar razer kraken owned slightly worse able compare two notice mic quality quite terrible honest sure could expect headset built mic think expected slightly price though rgb setting control headset desktop app need connect headset phone first download app sync phone choose custom colour sound setting reconnect pc kind hassle considering every time headphone turn reset original colour anyway seems bit tedious phone app yowu radio play music though cute guess basking bluetooth capability couple week realised battery life couple hour despite fact advertise hour literally found writing laugh definitely case mine whether fault unsure assuming standard bluetooth headphone meant needed start using plugged long gaming session unfortunately usb c supplied headphone constantly fall playing literally come loose drop using even falling entirely coming loose disconnected regardless slight movement head cut audio disconnect headset pc thought maybe type plug common realised never issue similar usb c device switch phone took admittedly several month realise headphone plug literally falling mid game normal aud headset time owned several month already decided contact yowu realised terrible customer service everyone talk initially took couple hour hear back told issue asked test usb c plug result coming loose falling went troubleshooting option maybe came closer admitting responsibility realised could longer guide helping sort response took week month back message instagram account complain getting reply via email found yowu even offer warranty kind fine small company headphone pricing big brand surprised assume responsibility considering fault seem quite common yowu lack warranty never clearly blatantly stated since contact last couple month headphone gotten worse sure related constantly disconnected reconnected issue microphone recognised bluetooth connecting correctly sound issue issue headset entire life far surprisingly offered repair headset assuming send back demanded pay shipping think enjoying headset enough pay another shipping almost price headphone kindly requested pay return cost two week since heard heard others issue demanding pay shipping eventually come around hoping happens sure experience going end considering owned razer kraken several year nothing compliment price far yowu plethora issue advise anyone low patience roundabout customer service poor quality steer clear yowu

1,"Does every TOTL headphone have a flaw? I've been in the market for a TOTL headphone recently and I've auditioned a number of them, but every single one of them seems to come with some kind of downside (with regards to build quality / longevity, comfort, and sound quality). I wanted to compile a short list of the ones I've tried and ask you guys about your experience with them. Headphones I have not tried will be marked with a \*.

**Headphones I've heard / researched in depth**:

Susvara - build quality, and thus longevity, is questionable (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/dulxaf/hifiman_susvara_impressions_diminishing_my_ortho/) amazing post by u/Feilong4)

Utopia - weight, lack of clamp, and headband design seem to make the headphone slightly uncomfortable

HD800S - really bright and makes instruments sound so far and small away that a lot of music seems to lose enjoyment for me (CAVEAT: I haven't tried these on tubes and there are extremely enjoyable for some tracks, which makes me want to get one anyways. Not perfect, but certainly has its own niche, especially for the price compared to these other headphones.)

Elite - at least to my ears, the technical performance is not competitive with the others on this list

1266 - I'm someone who really cares about the company who makes the headphone. I don't mind spending money on a headphone made by a company who has made mistakes and makes up for them, even if they are very money-hungry (e.g. Focal with build quality and, arguably, clipping, Hifiman with dying drivers, etc.), but if a company is as blatantly anti-consumer as Abyss, then I cannot support them in good faith. Also FR is whack (way too bright and really odd midrange IMO)

LCD5\* - according to Resolve (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJjBzsuJ9RA) around [8:55](https://youtu.be/EJjBzsuJ9RA?t=535)), the treble seems to be fairly recessed, a sentiment I agree with. Also, I despise glue-on pads with a passion.

Verite\* - from my understanding of my preference, frequency response seems kinda wonky without enough ear gain (see Crinacle's FR [here](https://crinacle.com/graphs/headphones/zmf-verite/))

**Other TOTL I don't know a lot about but have heard some stuff here and there**:

D8k Pro - uncomfortable and technicalities that don't match the price

Stax 009 - electrostat frailty makes me hesitant to spend that amount of money on one, plus FR is not the best

1,"Sennheiser HD599 vs HD6xx? Trying to decide. Hi, not a regular poster, but if this isn't the most active audiophile community, I dunno what is!  


So last month I purchased a pair of [***Sennheiser HD599 headphones.***](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01L1IICR2/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&amp;aaxitk=bd49fbf84ce829dbdda6fc1dc0cc9639&amp;hsa_cr_id=5146094670701&amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;pd_rd_r=4f7d70da-2dc8-4310-8867-31596007fbb5&amp;pd_rd_w=PQpHq&amp;pd_rd_wg=G4uBU&amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_0_img) Got them on sale. Love the color, love the sound, nothing is ""wrong"" with them.  


However, almost every forum post, YouTube review, and audiophile-related post says that the [***6xx, basically a discounted version of the HD600/650***,](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx) are on a whole other level of audio quality. I do have a Sound Blaster G6, which can power headphones up to 600 ohms, so it's not like I can't drive them to their fullest.  


But the problem is, I missed the Black Friday/Boxing Day sale, so I missed out paying $40 USD less. So it's no longer a no-brainer. :'(  


So my question is... should I take back the HD599s and order the HD6xx instead? Is it worth upgrading? 

Is it ""$60 USD better?"" (with shipping to Canada) to upgrade?

1,"Info about the Moondrop IEM waifus and their matching acrylic stands I see these posted here and there so I did some DD to dig into what is what. If you are unaware, Moondrop has been packaging their products with anime style artwork, so far individual anime girls per product. The IEMs have also had a few acrylic headphone stands sold separately that feature their corresponding waifu. I believe they are initially released at $9.99 USD, but the prices very per site. I do not own any of these and this is not a review or endorsement of any product. The post is purely meant to provide information. This is what I have found so far:

1. [Moondrop Chaconne](https://www.moondroplab.com/chaconne) - [head-fi.org link](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-chaconne.24110/reviews) - [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/bfIoPdA.jpg) - Chaconne is the first made and seems to be out of production. She is featured playing the violin and the pose matches the line drawing on the box of the IEM. She is often incorrectly named for some other IEM because they were commonly bundled with a few different sets. Make no mistake, there is only one Chaconne. She seems to be the toughest to find even on the secondary market.

2. [Moondrop SSR \(Super Starship Reference\)](https://www.moondroplab.com/ssr) - [head-fi.org link](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-ssr-super-starship-reference-review.24439/) - [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/l587qub.png) - The second acrylic released, SSR is a vocal specialist and is featured with her trademark microphone. The IEM come in green, pink, white, and silver. IMO pink or white work best with the acrylic stand, even though she does appear to be wearing the silver option. Googling around, SSR does still seem to be relatively easy to buy on the secondary market, albeit at a premium.

3. [Moondrop Kato](https://www.moondroplab.com/kato) - [head-fi.org link](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-kato-new-single-dynamic-driver-iem.25413/reviews) - [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/9P0kvtd.png) - The third and final (so far) acrylic to drop is Kato. The first non-musician of the group, it is possible for her to be a DJ, or a band manager, or perhaps just a fan. She is also visibly wearing her matching IEM, which leads me to think that Chaconne is also likely wearing hers, despite her ears being covered by her hair.

Am I making a mistake by going for the Zen DAC v1 instead of the V2? Or will I be fine?

1,"Does the playerdevice matter when using bluetooth? Good day,

Wondering whether someone could deny or confirm these feelings.
I have both an Sony walkman as well as an avarage midrange phone.

Obviously when using the 3.5 jack on both, the walkman sounds better even when having equalizers and other settings set up equally .. no surprise here.

Now im wondering. With wireless IEMs/headsets with bluetooth, does the quality of the player even matter?

I get the feeling that the music will have the same slight compression done to it anyway and stuff like the walkman having a better direct link and most likely better dac/amp shouldnt have influence when its send through bluetooth?

I could be fully wrong here though :D",playerdevice matter using bluetooth day wondering whether someone could deny confirm feeling sony walkman well avarage midrange phone obviously using jack walkman sound even equalizer setting set equally surprise im wondering wireless iems headset bluetooth quality player even matter feeling music slight compression done anyway stuff walkman direct link likely dac amp shouldnt influence send bluetooth could fully wrong though

1,"My Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (80 ohm) have very poor bass levels? I've been using Sony MDR-XB950AP headphones for the last years. But since I got heavily into music listening and want to start producing myself, I decided to get studio headphones. Those Sony ones were too bassy and muddy, so I wanted to stop my ears from getting used to unhealthy bass levels.

I got myself a new pair of DT 770 Pros (80 ohm). Of course I did expect a bit less bass, but it is much less than I expected. Burning them in for a few hours didn't help much. It makes anything I listen to less vibey. The Sonys are like listening music in the club, while the DT 770s feel... emotionless. I do appreciate their great clarity and much more available high levels, but the low bass makes the music emotionless.

So I wonder if those Sonys really just are extremely much too bassy and I got used to that or if something is wrong with the DT 770s. I read online that you should use an amplifier. But I also read that you only need an amplifier if the headphones are too quiet or if they distort, which both things are not the issue in my case. And I specifically got the 80 ohm version, because people said they can even use it on mobile. They said they don't need an amplifier.

I am driving them with my ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi motherboard.

On the inside of the headphones to the left and right of the leather padding are some screws holding in the headband paddings that is easily removed by a T4 bit. From there I cut a piece of plastic folder material to fit exactly the same as the leather headband. After selectively using the 3M adhesive the new Nugget band is interchangeable with the original! Hopefully this helps someone out there trying to solve their NDH-20 weight issues.

please tell me, can anyone know?

I bought Marshall major II Bluetooth headphones for my wife in 2018.

My wife used them 5 times, because she could not spread them. Pressed on the ears. After 4 years I decided to sell them and I was accused of selling fake. But I bought them in the official store of my country (OZON, they sell branded items at official prices)

According to all the data that I found on the Internet, these are official headphones and are not fake. BUT the label and their headband are painted black instead of gold. I haven't found anything like this all over the internet. Can someone give an order - is it a manufacturing defect or is it a fake?

1,"Blind sound testing of Schiit Modi3+/Magni3+ Vs JDS Atom DAC/AMP... definitely a difference I've been testing these for a week because I need to send one set back. I keep going back and forth. I will keep this discussion just to the sound differences, and I am curious people's opinions.

I have done multiple volume-matched, blind tests. I set both to the same decibel level on an audio meter, and ran them both through a pair of neutral HD560S cans. Both units were tested on low gain setting. I had someone switch out the inputs while playing songs, and I was separated and was unable to see or hear. The person also tried to trick me by leaving it on the same stack once.

The results were that I was absolutely able to notice the difference. I know some say the Schiit is warmer, and some say you can't tell whatsoever... but it was very noticable. 

The JDS is straight neutral and detailed. It basically doubles down on what the HD560S offers, and gives you absolute crisp detail, but powerful and punchy. Heavy guitar chords sound very detailed, but not heavy sounding in terms of weight and low/mid oopmh. But I was also able to hear all the layers of details surrounding the chords, the lighter background vocals, the percussion, background tracks, etc.

The Schiit immediately comes off warmer. The guitar chords have a lovely lower/mid growl to them. For casual enjoyment purposes, this is what I would prefer when listening to this kind of music. However, while the sound is warmer it also loses a little bit of detail. Some of the background vocals sound more distant or faded, and there is less sparkle. It does sort of bring the HD560s into a lovely state, almost as if EQd a bit.

I listened to various genres of music, and throughout, there was more sparkle and detail on the JDS and more warmth and thump to the Schiit. I very much appreciate both. 

I made this post for two reasons: 

1) Because I see many people on the internet saying you can't tell the difference, and I noticed a huge difference, and wanted to share

2) I am torn on which to keep. I enjoy the warmth the Schiit brings to my HD560s. However, I can EQ them to warm them up a bit. So I am starting to change my mind and think that the JDS being so neutral may be the better call here, as starting from neutral is always ideal rather than starting with a textured sound. I can EQ to gain warmth, but I can't EQ to bring back that lost detail. Thoughts on what is better for long term? I won't always be using just the HD560s on these...

1,"Alice in AudiophileLand - The First Signs Of Addiction This is going to be a long one so put on Headphones or IEM's and bear with me.

DISCLAIMER: This is a topic for discussion. This is not a hate post against the audiophile community. If by any means I offended you or your hobby I am really sorry. With that being said I would like to hear your thoughts but please keep it nice in the comments. 

PART 1: My short story on the audiophile world written long ( sorry )

I always liked to listen to music, speakers or headphones didn't really matter to me. Music always kept me company. Music is better than the real world I suppose. After many many years of having the same ridiculously aged pair of headphones, I decided to buy myself a nice pair for the last Xmas. The search started and I was confident that I would indeed find something nice for myself because after all, I could spend the amazing amount of  200 dollars. Long story short I tried almost all famous brands on that price range and all the types of headphones ( over the ear, on-ear, closed, open, solar-powered, stethoscopes, hearing aids, etc). Nothing really amazed me and made me wanna spend my hard-earned money. In a last attempt to finally get rid of my old set I started looking into IEM's. After many reviews and a limited amount of monitors that were available in my country, I went for the Fiio FH3. It was a gamble and I waited patiently for the moment that it would arrive. Thankfully they came one day before Xmas. I opened the box eagerly and tried them. They felt expensive and I was handling them with care.

The first song played and I was in love. The details were amazing. The notes were flying in front of me and I could almost catch them. The bass wanted to open a hole in my brain and I was willing to let it. If they were to test me for drugs at that very moment I am pretty sure the results would be positive. I hadn't had this feeling for a long time, since I last upgraded my old Headphones. 150 euros well spend. The next day it was even better, I could hear more details as my ears were adjusting I suppose to the new earphones. Everything was great but after about one week the honeymoon period started to end. I could still hear how superior those IEM's were to my previous ones over the years but still, I was missing something. The lower mid-range was lacking, the voices weren't that full and the mids weren't as rich as I would like them to be. 

So my search for a potential upgrade started. Videos, reviews, Reddit posts anything that could help me find what I was missing from my FH3. There was one obvious solution, I had to spend more. So I started to search for the IEM's that linger in the 200 dollar area. After that 200 dollars started filling cheap, after all that's how everyone is treating them. ""Good for the money"" everyone always says. I had to go further. 300 dollars, 400 dollars, 500 dollars. Even me being obsessed over this knew that I wouldn't dare to go over that so I settled in finding a good pair of monitors for under 500 dollars. 

Nothing seemed perfect even in that price range. Everything came with its own flows ( according to reviews). After all, they cost only 500 dollars how could I expect them to be TOTL quality? So what happened in a matter of days is that I went from "" I am willing to spend 200 dollars to buy some of the best Headphones"" to "" I will give 500 dollars but still I will have something that will feel cheap and just a poor men's taste of Hi-Fi"". I went from looking into IEM's like the Moondrop Variations and hoping I would be able to grab them one day, to look at them, and being willing to spend the money but in my eyes, they were a compromise of what I would have wanted. So then it's like I woke up and realized how paranoid I have been for the last days. 

PART 2: How prices changed in my mind and money became numbers

Now I understand that if I got carried away, being only days into this hobby, I can't even imagine how people that are doing this for years see those ""cheap Headphones"". I would like you to know that I am aware that not everyone is in the same boat. The economy over countries is different and also people in the same countries have very different economic capabilities. If you can afford the high prices and you find the joy in doing so and feel fulfilling then no one has the right to say otherwise. 

Having said that ( as a self-criticism more than anything else) I still can't understand how 200 dollars changed from feeling such a big investment into feeling absolute garbage in my mind. My FH3 from feeling like a premium product started feeling like a 10 dollar earbud in my hands. A few months prior to this I had built a new desktop capable of running my 3D software. I paid around 900 dollars and I was very skeptical of doing so even if I knew that my 10-year-old laptop wouldn't do the job anymore. And here I was searching for IEM's that were more than half the price of my beautiful new computer and feeling like they are a cheap man's joy. 

PART 3: The truth that I faced about the overpriced products

Two pieces that weigh 10 grams of metal that could fit in my palm would cost more than my refrigerator. They cost more than my computer, they cost more than what I am being paid on monthly basis, and still, reviewers treat them like budget items ""Good for the price"". Those are Chinese-made. I will say it one more time. Those are made in China. The material costs are probably less than 20 dollars. You could argue that you pay for the technology involved and I would say to you that a few years back I couldn't dream of a resin 3D printer and now I can buy a really really good one for under 500 dollars. 

Second realizations. Companies just charge what they think they can charge with no other factor playing a role. Imagine that a brand can make a super good  IEM or headphones and price it over 1000 dollars. Then when they want to make a budget version they mesh deliberately with the tunning to make it worse because come on what cutting off materials can they do on a 10-gram piece of gear. And even worse most of them have the audacity to cheap on ear tips and cable quality. 

To end this post.

 I will continue my search for good products at reasonable prices since  I can't really go back. I get that this is an expensive hobby but it really doesn't have to be. The only reason why companies charge that much is because they can and because we are like junkies that are always searching for a nice ""hit"". Also as a last thought, I really despise reviewers that treat expensive pieces of gear like s\*\*\*\*t and call Headphones and IEM'S that cost more than most could afford ""budget"" items.

1,"Drop O2 + SDAC vs ifi Zen DAC v2 Hello,

As someone new in this space I really need some advice regarding the DAC/Amp to be used with my 2 headphones: Sundara and HD 58x. I am currently using the Drop O2 + SDAC and I think it works well with both headphones but since I am new  have not used any other Amp so I do not know if I  an get more out of my equipment. A local AV store has the Zen v2 for the equivalent of 145 USD. I am also looking to swap the HD 58x to a HD 660s later down the line. My question is: should I replace the O2 with the Zen v2 or it won't count as an upgrade but more of a sidegrade? I see the iFi get lauded as very good but the extra features over O2 do not apply to me (I do not have speakers, IEMs and I run single-ended).

Thank you for reading my wall of text and for any insight you can give me.",drop sdac v ifi zen dac v hello someone space need advice regarding dac amp used headphone sundara hd currently using drop sdac think work well headphone since used amp equipment local av store zen v equivalent usd swap hd hd later line question replace zen v count upgrade sidegrade see ifi lauded extra feature apply speaker iems run single ended thank reading wall text insight give

1,"What would be your dream setup? No holds bar Hello,

Basically for me would be an upgrade for what I have at this moment.

For context I use the following: Beyerdynamic DT770 (250 ohm), Sennheiser HD660s and FiiO FH3. They are paired with Topping E30 + L30 stack. Their use is 85% gaming and the rest for music, movies, other content, but this isn't that relevant (i guess).

My dream setup would be: 

* Open-back: Sennheiser HD800s / DT1990 (can't decide... the DT design is so appealing to me)
* IEM: Sennheiser IE900 
* Closed-back: not sure yet (maybe DT 700 Pro X or DT 1770)
* These would be paired with the Topping A90 + D90.

Don't get me wrong, I am very pleased with what I have right now. I won't replace them for years to come.

1,"Is there a standard for mini XLR pinout? AKG headphone cables have L/R channels reversed? I replaced the cable of an AKG K273 Pro, and found out that the left and right channels are swapped. Who is to ""blame"" or is there no standard for a miniXLR---3.5mm plug cable pinout?

Turns out that the original AKG cable and the new non-AKG cable are wired differently. Looking at the mini XLR connector of the cable:

AKG cable:
3 == tip    == left channel
2 == ring   == right channel
1 == sleeve == ground

New cable (""3.5mm 1/8'' TRS Aux Male to Mini XLR 3-Pin Female Audio Cable"")
3 == ring   == right channel
2 == tip    == left channel
1 == sleeve == ground

I currently have a DT770, which I had for about 6-7 years now. I like it but the plastic pieces to the sides broke. I saw that I can replace them for 20‚Ç¨, but that seems like a good opportunity to buy a new 400‚Ç¨ pair of headphones instead ! I was thinking about buying the HD660s.

Is it really worth it ? Shoud I expect to be blown away, or just get a small improvement ? I think most of the difference will come from the fact that the Sennheiser is an open back. But I hope that I will also get more details.

I also have a question for my signal path. I am currently doing this:

Motherboard &gt; Sound card (Asus Xonar DX) &gt; Amp (Yamaha AS301) &gt; Headphones out.

Is this the way to go or should I do it differently?

Also, I see that most of you guys have dedicated headphones DACs and Amps. Should I stay with my Yamaha AS301 (which ill keep anyway since im using it for my speakers), or getting a dedicated headphones DAC/Amp will also make a difference?

Additionally, right now, I have an O2 Headphone amp + hd58x jubilee combo that is connected to my UR22mkII, which is then connected directly to my motherboard through USB 2.0. As such, here are my questions:

1) Is there any good alternative to the DROP + EPOS PC38X, preferably wireless? I am looking for a headphone/set that has a good sound stage and is good for both FPS gaming and music/movies.

2) Would the sound card that comes with my UR22mkII be better than the sound card that comes with my motherboard? I have an MSI tomahawk b560 wifi as my motherboard. in other words, should I change my sound setup around?

1,"I can suddenly hear little pops and cracks in music I've been listening to for years and never heard before, is this a thing with music or is there something wrong with all my devices? I got some new iems (wf 1000-xm4) and was listening to Spotify closely to be sure they weren't faulty as I have now returned oh so many headphones by now as they kept failing and I kept upgrading every few months, I love them and they sounds fantastic, definitely my favourite ones since the RHA T20 got discontinued and I couldn't get them anymore. But I began to notice little imperfections, like pops and cracks, in my music. I listen almost exclusively to rap type stuff so big thumps are hardly uncommon, but after going through all of the songs I've listened to for hours and hours at a time I was positive it wasn't in my head. The sounds weren't consistent with the beat, and therefore likely intentional, but they are at consistent time stamps throughout the song. I was pretty sure it was a Bluetooth/headphones issue, but when I got home and listened using my new grados, I had the exact same cracks. Tried all the settings the Sony's had to offer as well as Spotify to no avail. New phone (that had just been completely nuked and had software re installed) had the same issues. Support has supposedly cleaned up my corrupted cache files, hasn't fixed it.

1,"Shure AONIC 215 TW2 EQ conversion mod The shure aonic 215 gen2 is basically a true wireless bluetooth adapter slapped on a wired 215 since it has an mmcx connector. The 2nd gen connects to the shure app and gives you a full fledged parametric EQ that saves the profile directly into the hardware. This potentially means you can swap the bluetooth adapter to any mmcx iem you want and get a parametric EQ that applies *system wide* no matter what it's connected to or what you're playing. Shure seems to know this, because that specific adapter alone is sold for $180, which is the same price with the iems included. I think this could be a gamechanging moment for those that don't want to lug around a BT adapter that connects to the physical cable of an iem, and would rather be wire free.",shure aonic tw eq conversion mod shure aonic gen basically true wireless bluetooth adapter slapped wired since mmcx connector nd gen connects shure app give full fledged parametric eq save profile directly hardware potentially mean swap bluetooth adapter mmcx iem want parametric eq applies system wide matter connected playing shure seems specific adapter alone sold price iems included think could gamechanging moment want lug around bt adapter connects physical cable iem rather wire free

1,"Suggestions for headphones similar to AKG K240S with the fit of the Beyer DT770? ($150-200 range) Hi all, first time posting to this sub! I've been using AKG K240S's forever, and although I don't think they're the gold standard of build quality or anything, I really like the sound - I find that they lean toward the darker side with pretty prominent low end, but not muddy.

Just recently, I picked up a pair of DT770's, and I thought they'd be a sure thing. I really just wanted an alternate pair to have around, something a bit more ""premium"" feeling with those nice soft ear cups. Well, the build quality and comfort is phenomenal. 

However, I have listened and listened to them with a bunch of genres, and I can't get over the very prominent high-mid range. I find it very fatiguing and, although it has some nice sub-bass, the abundance of high-mid makes the bass feel subdued in comparison to the AKGs.

I know that a lot of people love and swear by the DT770s, but I just don't know if they're the right pair for me. Any alternate suggestions for an alternate closed-back pair in the $150-200 range that perhaps doesn't have quite the prominent high-mid range? I like a nice warm low end and wide sound stage. Kind of like a ""better"" version of the K240's, if there is such a thing.

Sometimes, I plug my rig into my MBP. And sometimes my PC. On the mac, 3.5mm Out. On pc, same thing. 3.5mm Out from Rear I/O. On both machines, Volume Out is set at 70. But, there are times that I think the volume knob is turned too high for it's own good. Like the volume will be like 2pm or so. So it makes me think, ""Should it really be that high?"" Should I have the source output higher like 80, 85, 90,+? That way the volume out to the dac is higher? I had picked 70 for a unresearched view on it ""Clipping"" if it went any higher.

1,"Headphones with an in-line mutable mic I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit for this request.  Please feel free to point me in the right direction and I'll gladly delete the post.

I work from home and was supplied a pair of usb logitech headphones (a headset with a microphone).  They are on-ear, which I can't really handle for nine hours a day any longer.  I have a physical skin condition which makes having the pads actually on my ears excruciating after a short amount of time. 

The audio quality isn't of extreme importance (I do realize the irony of that in this sub, apologies), but a decent (or slightly more than passable) quality microphone and over the ear headphones would be a huge upgrade for me personally.  They would have to be USB, per work guidelines.  

And importantly, it would require a physically mutable microphone switch. 

 In-line (on the cable as opposed to the headset itself) would be very much ideal, so I'm visually aware of when the mic is muted and unmuted.  (My current Logitech set has an in-line switch which blinks when it's muted.) 

Anything around or less than $100 is ideal but I can spring for higher if necessary. 

I do realize those are a lot of parameters for the request, but I'm hoping that anyone else might be able to give a suggestion here.  

I don't have any expectations at all, but am hoping something may fit those parameters. I've tried to look online, but haven't found any over the ear, usb headsets with a mic and an in-line mutable switch.

1,"Too afraid to ask regarding blind testing/placebo.. Has everyone here A/B/X tested their schiit/jds/etc ""budget"" stacks against onboard sound with an input switcher + some way of properly volume matching? I can't say I have...I've only gone back and forth to the best of my ability. Posts here containing more expensive dacs/amps always seem to be met with skepticism with comments mentioning the importance of blind testing (rightfully so) and in my observation almost always discount any perceived improvements as placebo/improper testing (perhaps less rightfully so?). 

I can't help but feel like I'm part of the problem, even with more budget friendly gear.

Olbass All Bass 004 (140BPM) - Vegyn. The additional bass on the 80x's over the e series (while not all that impressive) makes listening to the fast paced separation of this song very satisfying over a bass backing with substance

And he says that he doesn't really hear any difference in terms of sound quality, settings aside the fact that the iPhone obviously doesn't have as much headroom as an amp has. But he could however achieve a comfortable volume level listening from an iPhone, so that wasn't a problem. I also don't really listen to music really loud (currently using HD 280 PROs as my daily cans (64 ohms) and the interface's volume knob is barely 1/3 turned up).

But in my earlier post, I complained about the sub-bass imbalance of my pair of DT770 pros. 

I wrote to my provider and they sent me a replacement. But upon listening to the new pair I didn't hear any difference. They sounded nearly identical. So I assumed that it was because I didn't hook them up to an Amp. Shortly after I got the Fiio E10K TC. But no difference. It just made the problem more noticeable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried some things, like swapping headphones and/or pressing on the sides of the headphones. I also tried tightening the headphones to try and get a better seal. But didn't help much. 

Something else I tried was to measure the headphones with a multimeter. On the left channel, I get a reading of 77, and on the right, I got a reading of 78. Is this different enough to make an audible difference? 

Would it help to change the earpads or swap sides?

1,"Using Peace EQ and REQ Lately ive been experimenting a lot with the eq in peace eq/apo. I wanted to get the most of my he400i 2020  as they dont have the best sound out of the box.

I inputed the FR of HD600 (Oratory1990) in REQ and used it as a house curve to set a target for my HE400i

Then i downloaded the FR of the HE400i 2020 made by Oratory 1990 and also inputed it in REW.

I used the eq window of REW and matched the HD600 and HE400i to the same volume (or target response)

Then i carefully set peaks (20 in total) with eq filters for the 400i to match with the HD600s FR. 

I toke note of the peaks (eq filters) and inputed then into the Peace eq (i also increased the sub bass but didnt boose it)

Now I know this wont make the sound identical to the hd600, but there is a night and day difference from the original FR and this eq version.

Everything is better from vocals to the removal of siblance.

Im very impressed with the possibilities of EQing. (Also apparently the 400i has very low WHD making it great for equing)

I upgraded my KZ ZSN Pros (1BA 1DD) to the KZ ZS10 Pros (4BA 1DD) and then the CCA CA16 (7BA 1DD). Note that I worked my way up with the amount of drivers and was always amazed how much better each addition sounded. While the first two were replaced because the wire corroded near the connections to the buds the CCAs had the left earbud slowly lose volume and die so I had to get a whole new set not just a new wire (if anyone has a good source lmk down below). I decided to get the KZ AS16 because of the similar amount of drivers but I feel it doesn't sound as vibrant and textured without the Dynamic Driver. There also is a noticeable hiss from them for a few seconds after pausing audio which I never had with my CCAs.

Does anyone have experience with one or both of these IEMs? Can you tell me your experience and thoughts on them, or anything comparable with the same or more drivers?

1,"Austrian Audio HI-X65 First Impressions (vs HD600/580) &amp;#x200B;

So I am very early on in my X65 journey. I am a little over 6 hours in and I'm gonna give my first impressions vs the HD600, my daily driver.  


The unboxing is exquisite. Very. Very premium. Every headphone should be like this, it screams quality. The hand checked verification card is just great, the unboxing could not be a better experience. I'd buy these again for the unboxing alone if my wallet would handle it.   


The comfort and fit is nice. Not as clampy as the HD600, but still nice. I have a small head and I don't need to move the adjustments at all and it fits and seals well. I do wish velour pads were an option. I don't like leather that much but this is subjective. Comfort is great, but I prefer the HD600. The X65 weigh more than the HD600, but to me and my weightlifting lifestyle, it's a non-issue. The leather does isolate more than the velour and I was surprised at the isolation for an open back, they still leak sound a lot so... be weary. The same if not more than the HD600. Comparable to my HE500 I used to own, leaks more than the DT 1990. The cups are nice and deep and very roomy (for me, again, this is subjective)  


Sound wise, (I am a simple guy who likes metal music and gaming, I don't like audiophile terms that much but will do my best here to explain)  
\[Without EQ\] They're fine without EQ, I think overall sound is better on the HD600 without EQ, it does feel like more bass is present with a slightly better punch.  
The mids sound a bit recessed in some areas and just right in others. Vocals sound good but lacking somewhat, electric guitars sound slightly distant. It sounds like everything is there, just lacking the ""intangibles"".  
Treble is just right imo. It sounds more present than the HD600 but not sibilant like the DT1990 I also used to own.  
\[With EQ\] Take everything I said and add those ""intangibles"". The bass gets slighty more punchiy with more nuance, electric guitars have that body behind it, mids sound more full, and the treble gets slightly better. I'll have my current EQ below at the bottom. Suffice to say, with eq, it's great. I think without EQ, some of the mids sound scared, they're there and you can tell it's there, they just need a confidence boost.   


Soundstage and Imaging: Good. They're headphones. Headphone soundstage (imo) is almost always over-exaggerated or overemphasized. The soundstage is wide enough. More wide than the HD600, on par with the 1990/Ether 2 if memory serves correctly. Imaging is solid, not as 3-bloby like the HD600 and I have no issues with playing Halo Infinite or Stardew Valley (the latter is being slightly disingenuous to real gamers).  
Instrument separation is also great. No issues on that front either. I didn't think the HD600 was bad (still don't) but there is clearly more separation between instruments.

Detail is great in my opinion. I don't feel like I'm losing out on anything being presented in music or what have you.  


So far overall, I really like them. I just wish there were velour pads for them. I don't think the leather pads are bad or anything, I just prefer velour feeling wise. I contacted Austrian Audio and they said they had no plans to make velour pads anytime soon.  


Will make a more in depth review in a week or two.  


My EQ Profile: I am using my ears to this, no measurements. My ears like what they hear, not what is seen on a graph.... mostly.  
Bass shelf +3-4 dB (I usually stick with +3.5db) @ 100 hz  
Peak Filter: 1.5kHz Q 1.5 + 4 dB

1,"Schiit Stack - Basic Volume Control in MacOS? Hi there,

I have a Magni/Modi stack, and of course, I can control the volume using the physical knob. However, while this works for most things, if I need to quickly change volume via keyboard shortcuts (since my hands are mostly placed on the keyboard), I can't, because there's no ""Volume"" to speak of (I guess the  DAC does not expose any ""volume"" control to MacOS). Is there any way to digitally decrease volume before the signal gets to the amp that's also configurable in the OS?

1,"Tried bone-conduction earphones...I don't get it? (but they're still cool) After hearing about the functionality of them for a long time, I finally bought and tried the OpenMove earphones from Shokz (nee AfterShokz) and, while they're definitely nifty as headphones, I don't get the ""bone conduction part"".

They're still worth it for the open ear (I like hearing my surroundings) and multipoint pairing. Really neat and I'm glad I got them.

But as for the ""bone conduction"", they really just seem like they're tiny little speakers that happen to be *near* your ears instead of on them. I even ""hovered"" them over (not touching) my ear canal with my hands, and I still heard the audio at least as well, no ""vibration"" needed. And when my daughter uses them, I can hear the music if I place my head next to hers.

So it kinda seems like they're just well-focused normal audio, not entirely unlike ordinary on-ear headphones (i.e. not buds or over-ears).

I have a desire to play my music louder than my living situation really allows so I have decided to take the plunge and buy a pair of Hifiman Sundaras (I already own a pair of sony wx1000xm3 for commuting/gaming but these just don't seem to be musically focussed, but they have a role).

My question is would I receive any real benefit from an 'audiophile' perspective in purchasing additional amp and DAC specially for my Sundaras, or will me plugging into my Marantz PM7000n or Scarlet Solo do the trick?

1,"Headphone advice - A closed back under ¬£200? Hi.

I currently own the 2020 version of the HE400i and use it with a V1 zendac. Before this I was using steel series gaming headphones(lol), but a friend who is an audiophile convinced me on the purchase. I've had my setup nearly a year and its been a great entry into the audiophile world. I use my headphones for Gaming(Mostly fps) and a vast array of music(DnB to Hip hop to classical to Jazz to Dubstep). I love this setup, the wide soundstage and clarity of the audio. BUT I do find that the Bass lacks for some genres and sometimes im in the mood for more bassy audio. Therefore I am looking for (I think) a closed back set of headphones to add to my collection.

These will be plugged into the Zendac also. These will be purely used indoors in my quiet bedroom so isolation doesn't matter and I never intend to use them in public. I want a more bass driven set of headphones, because I find my HE400i quite balanced, but I still want the bass to be quality bass and nothing blown out and stupid. I really enjoy the HE400i that I have and don't seek a replacement for them, moreso an addition to support them. I love the soundstage of the HE400i but I'm ok with the new pair to not have that wide soundstage in return for a higher quantity of quality bass. I'll be using these headphones solely for music because I love the HE400i for gaming, bass heavy genres like DnB, dubstep etc. I live in the UK and I'm looking for something under ¬£200.

Any recommendations, help, advice etc will be massively appreciated. I got my HE400i and zendac literally through recommendation of a friend and didn't really do any self research. Now that I'm trying to myself I've found that there are so many conflicting opinions and preferences in the audiophile community that its really difficult for me to understand what to look at.

If I need to add anything more to this please let me know. I've tried to be as detailed as possible.

These sound really good, like 8 or 9/10 for most music I enjoy and around 8/10 for gaming.  But, for the price, I was hoping to hit 10/10 with some of my music and I just don't hear it.  I also have an HD800s, an LCD-X 2021, and a DT-1990.  The HD800s wows me with some music (jazz, classical, orchestra) and with gaming.  The LCD-X wows me with all my favorite genres of my music.  The DT-1990 is a solid performer all around, but no real wow factor, honestly like the Focal Clear MG.  But see here's the thing...the DT-1990 is less than half the price of the Focal Clear MG.  For the price of the MG I was hoping to get blown away like I was with the LCD-X and HD800s.

Most reviewers praise the Focal Clear, but a lot of the time it's the OG, not the MG.  Opinions seem conflicted, but many seem to prefer the OG and many seem to prefer the MG.

My question for everyone, is the MG too ""tame"" and is the wow factor with the OG?  Should I sell the MG and grab an OG on [headphones.com](https://headphones.com) while they still have them?  Or...am I looking for something that isn't there?  Perhaps I should just sell the MG and leave it; I love the three others I own anyway.

1,"AIAIAI W+ (H10 + X01) Initial Thoughts After Two Days of Use I have had a pair of AIAIAI TMA-2's since early 2018 that are still going strong. Genuinely love them and the company as a whole, especially their modularity. I have upgraded my speaker units and the earpads over the years and they always felt like new and crisp sounding with the right balance (FLAT, MY FRIENDS) after burn-in.

When I saw the W+ version come out, I was tempted to get them but also didn't want to spend the money on the whole new set so I opted for the W+ upgrade package (Modularity!) with the H10 headband and X01 transmitter which you can buy as a set without the additional cost of speaker units or earpads.

So I DO like the product but I have some thoughts additionally that people should know before buying.

**First thing that anyone should know about this product, it hisses like a snake**: 

The X01 transmitter sends a hiss to the H10 headband and out of your speaker units of choice that is absolutely horrendous at high volumes. The hiss is there basically no matter what unless you switch from W+ to Bluetooth, which of course would mean that you are not using the X01 at all. Like some other future-forward wireless audio products I have used in the past decade, the hiss seems to be a feature not a bug due to the nature of wireless transmission (i.e. there is shit in the air and we don't live in radio frequency free boxes, at least not yet) and AIAIAI even has documentation on it's site FAQ about the X01 + H10 combo about how to reduce the hiss. I am currently using their neon green cable out of the box, coming out of my 1/4"" port on my Focusrite Scarlett Solo which is plugged via USB-C into my MacBook Pro.

**Second thing, the ""Lossless"" Audio**:

Is the X01 supposed to be a DAC? You would think so reading their website if you weren't super informed on such matters.

From the AIAIAI website:

* **""*****UNCOMPRESSED AND LOSSLESS AUDIO -*** ***Uncompressed and stable 16bit connection from larger bandwith and dual antennas.""***

The answer to the DAC question is a hard no. While the marketing materials claim that the X01 is sending ""lossless"" audio, it's not sending lossless audio in the audiophile sense.  Which is to say, the only thing ""lossless"" is the original source of the input to the X01, so you will already need to be listening to audio at a higher lossless bit-rate, and outputting via a DAC, obviously increasing the ""chain"" here but with the obvious advantage of no longer being tethered to your DAC.  

My only real gripe here is that the USB-C port on the X01 is strictly for charging and cannot be used as an audio input which in my humble opinion was a colossal mistake of engineering, although I'm sure it would have made the product cost slightly more to add an efficient DAC. I wrongly assumed that I could use the USB-C input for audio as well, which I have to assume is a mistake someone else will make in purchasing, although perhaps I'm an optimistic idiot (I am) .

The only option for audio input on the X01 is via 3.5mm, although I did order a USB-C to 3.5mm cable that I am going to attempt to use to listen to some Lossless audio on Apple Music via my iPad Pro tomorrow and see if that works well.  

Regardless, these are definitely what they are billed as, *Creator* headphones. 

If you already have a nice audio setup and the only thing you are looking to rid yourself of is a long cable tethering you to your workstation, these are definitely a good buy, especially if you are upgrading a previous pair of TMA-2's and can suitably calibrate your output to reduce the hiss.

For casual listening however, it's a pain in the ass. 

**Third thing, not really for casual listening (see above, and obviously below)**:

I could never use the W+ system with my iPhone 13 Pro for instance with a Lossless audio source like Apple Music or Tidal (but not Spotify HiFi since it still doesn't exist goddamnit...) because I would need a portable Lightning DAC sticking out of my phone and into the X01 which is just untenable for mobile usage. I would consider getting something like a THX Onyx for my iPad if the USB-C to 3.5mm cable doesn't do the trick, but the bottom line is that unless you are already set up for audio at a high level of quality, you are going to have to invest in way more than just the W+ system to get the optimal use out of them.

Will report back once I try out other combinations of the chain.

I have also reached out to my contacts at the company to see if there is anything additional I can get from in terms of optimization.

**TL;DR -** Don't buy or upgrade an existing pair of TMA-2's unless you are already have a DAC or amp because you will just be setting yourself up to spend more money, unless of course you like spending more money on things you just bought to make them work properly.  Also, they hiss non-stop even though you can reduce it with calibration. Overall a nice upgrade to untether thyself but a bit of a pain to get it to ""fit"" your chain properly depending on the use case.",aiaiai w h initial thought two day pair aiaiai tma since early still going strong genuinely love company whole especially modularity upgraded speaker unit earpads year always felt crisp sounding right balance flat friend burn saw w version come tempted want spend money whole set opted w upgrade package modularity h headband transmitter buy set without additional cost speaker unit earpads product thought additionally people buying first thing anyone product hiss snake transmitter sends hiss h headband speaker unit choice absolutely horrendous high volume hiss basically matter unless switch w bluetooth course mean using future forward wireless audio product used past decade hiss seems feature bug due nature wireless transmission e shit air live radio frequency free box least yet aiaiai even documentation site faq h combo reduce hiss currently using neon green cable box coming port focusrite scarlett solo plugged via usb c macbook pro second thing lossless audio supposed dac think reading website super informed matter aiaiai website uncompressed lossless audio uncompressed stable bit connection larger bandwith dual antenna answer dac question hard marketing material claim sending lossless audio sending lossless audio audiophile sense say thing lossless original source input already need listening audio higher lossless bit rate outputting via dac obviously increasing chain obvious advantage longer tethered dac real gripe usb c port strictly charging cannot used audio input humble opinion colossal mistake engineering although sure made product cost slightly add efficient dac wrongly assumed could usb c input audio well assume mistake someone else make purchasing although perhaps optimistic idiot option audio input via mm although order usb c mm cable going attempt listen lossless audio apple music via ipad pro tomorrow see work well regardless definitely billed creator headphone already nice audio setup thing rid long cable tethering workstation definitely buy especially upgrading previous pair tma suitably calibrate output reduce hiss casual listening however pain as third thing casual listening see obviously could never w system iphone pro instance lossless audio source apple music tidal spotify hifi since still exist goddamnit need portable lightning dac sticking phone untenable mobile usage consider getting something thx onyx ipad usb c mm cable trick bottom line unless already set audio high level quality going invest way w system optimal report back try combination chain reached contact company see anything additional term optimization tl dr buy upgrade existing pair tma unless already dac amp setting spend money unless course spending money thing bought make work properly hiss non stop even though reduce calibration overall nice upgrade untether thyself bit pain fit chain properly depending case

1,"iem/headphone modding information Hi all. Are there any articles that go over various aspects of tuning headphones and IEMs? I found some, especially for fostex headphones that I guess apply to most. 

I especially would appreciate any info on IEM tuning. 

e.g. I've experimented with different tips for seal, but also taming highs in screechy IEMs like my shuoer tape. I forced some dual flange etymotic tips on it, and the narrow nozzle seems to have killed much of the ""harshness"" - sorry, I'm not quite as eloquent as some.. 

I've seen other tricks online - Tanchjim Tanya has filters that I've seen people place on other iem that take high end peaks.

If a resource doesn't exist perhaps we can make one?

1,"Grabbed a sweet pair of LCD-GX cans and confused on powering Hey everyone,

I saw these at a great price and figured I would bite the bullet and give it a try.

Soo my delima is: I currently use a Beyerdynamic Fox mic and plug my beyerdynamic tygr headphones into it. I use the microphone daily.

I wish to switch to these lcd-gx, not positive how good the mic quality is I wanted to retain using my beyerdynamic fox as the main mic and use the super cool double cable to the headphones for audio.

Except that cable has a large audio plug (1/4"") which my motherboard does not support. So I just go with a 1/4 to 1/8 adapter and plug into my motherboard and mooozy on? Or should I somehow power them in between it all to utilize my fox mic?

1,"Where to buy Ultimate Ears FITS outside of US? I have one slightly misformed ear, most normal earphones can't stay in, because that little area of your ear that allows the plug to 'hang"" in is too small. It's not a very visible thing but it means I can only use headphones. Some in-ears do work fine but not for more than 30-40min. 

The FITS seem like an affordable solution. But I can't find them anywhere in the EU. Ultimate Ears is a common brand here, no idea why the FITS aren't available. 

Does anyone have any idea?
