Earbuds,"Bought a pair of Soundcore Liberty Air 2 and I'm having issues with the right earbud connectivity/pairing Hello, everyone

I bought a pair of Soundcore Liberty Air 2 refurbished on Amazon that arrived on Tuesday and since then my usage of the earbuds have been very limited due to the connectivity/pairing issues on the right earbud.

From the second time I use them after reseting and pairing them to my Galaxy S10, the right earbud just shuts down and reboots every 2 minutes. The only way I can fix this is to reset and pair them again until I put them in the box again and then I need to repeat this process. 

I've tried this multiple times and sometimes the reseting takes a bunch of times to actually reset properly.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

Is there a way to fix this or should I return them?

Thank you!",bought pair soundcore liberty air issue right earbud connectivity pairing hello everyone bought pair soundcore liberty air refurbished amazon arrived tuesday since usage earbuds limited due connectivity pairing issue right earbud second time reseting pairing galaxy right earbud shuts reboots every minute way fix reset pair put box need repeat process tried multiple time sometimes reseting take bunch time actually reset properly anyone ever experienced something way fix return thank

Earbuds,"wireless earbuds with deep bass like the Earfun Free Pro but overall better? Ok so I have the Earfun Free Pro and it's pretty nice, specially I love how the bass is. Deep and you can even feel the vibration.

However it's missing clarity in other frequencies which my other earbuds do better. (Huawei Pro)

I was wondering if there's an option which combines the two of them.
I was looking at the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Sennheiser Momentum 2.
I watched some reviews but honestly they all say very contradictory things regarding the bass so I'm not sure.

Earbuds,"My personal list of Top Wireless Earbuds under $50 (2022) Over the past one year, I have personally tested and reviewed quite a fair bit of budget wireless earbuds. From crappy ones which cost only $5 from Taobao to amazing ones which cost around $50-60

still, there are thousands of budget &amp; affordable wireless earbuds out there right now, jammed pack with all kinds of features and I am sure many of you are having a tough time picking the right one for yourself.

So for my own lost, I am gonna talk about the three general types of users:

* Active lifestyle
* Average Joe, Average Jane
* Audio folks

**Average Joe, Average Jane**

These are the ""Everyday"" people. Usually they doesn't really ask for much but Just wants something which just works and works well.

Right off my mind, I would recommend the Baseus ENCOK WM01

It is Compact and sports a slick design

it is Easy to operate, fuss-free pairing &amp; re-connection, good battery life (5hrs @ 70% vol), decent audio quality

It uses USB-C charging

Even though it has no IPX rating, don‚Äôt worry about sweat if you hit the gym or go for a jog occasionally. It‚Äôs tested and proven by me \^.\^

&amp;#x200B;

**Active lifestyle**

If you are a gym-goer, the runner, the cyclist, the X-fitter, the Muay-thai, the F45-er, or basically exercise, working out is a big part of your lifestyle,

Then I would recommend either the MPOW MDots or the CKFN F18 ANC

These earbuds are literally waterproof, except for MDots as it is IPX6 rated while CKFN is IPX7 rated

This means that you can bring them for jetski, water-boarding, high intensity workouts etc, they will just continue to play your favourite tunes even if they are covered completely with sweat &amp; water

During my testing, these earbuds provide good seal which is important, especially if you workout in noisy gyms.

But if you really want to block out those noise, Then go for the CKFN F18 as they have Active noise cancellation features which will free your ears from those noises

Now, if you are someone who likes to do extreme sports, MDots include free earwings to ensure they are glued to your ears even when you are doing backflips or 720s.

Both also deliver decently loud volume output, decent audio quality and more importantly, BASS

&amp;#x200B;

**Audio Folks**

If you are concerned about experience, how your music sounds, the Bass, the soundstage etc, I would recommend the X-Mini Liberty+ Wireless Earbuds

Even though it uses 6mm Graphene-coated dynamic drivers. But these tiny guys are powerful.

They deliver good strong bass but not overpowering the treble.

When I listen to Pop and R&amp;B, these bring out the bass for a more satisfying listen.

Even when it comes to EDMs, these earbuds further accentuate them. Even though the sub-bass may not satisfy audiophiles but imo, it would definitely satisfy most bass lovers

Vocals are clear and doesn‚Äôt sound muddy

Sound stage is good. The instruments are spread out in a wide space. This tiny guys also support Qualcomm Aptx¬†

Finally, with a battery life of nearly 10 hours on a single charge and the case providing an additional 45 hours of playtime. You definitely don‚Äôt need to worry about that 8-hour playlist which your Airpods Pro will never be able to complete.

So honestly there are so many earbuds I have reviewed in 2021 and up till the making of this video, I have tested over 50 pairs. But this list is surprisingly easy to make as these are the fellows which left an impression on me throughout 2021. And they have always been at the top of my list.¬†

ButI hope this helped you to pick the right budget Wireless earbuds. Those are my choices. Let me know what are your own top wireless earbuds (under $50)

Earbuds,"Silicone-capped in-canal buds hurt me; I need BT buds more like standard Airpods I'm looking for some bluetooth earbuds but, other than standard Airpods, I'm having a hard time finding anything that doesn't do the thing where it sits in your ear canal with an inverted silicone cup sealing it off and holding it in place with pressure against the walls of the canal.

Unfortunately I can only wear in-canal buds for a very short time before they become painful. I need the more classic kind of earbud where it's cupped and held in place at the opening of the canal by the outer cartilage of the ear, like standard Airpods are.

And yes, Airpods themselves are an obvious option. They're a good product. The problem is that I don't care for how Apple does business and especially how it handles tech support, so I prefer not to buy their products (let's not get into it, ok?). So that's a last-resort choice for me. I'd prefer to see what other options I have.

If anyone has any leads, I'd really appreciate it.

Earbuds,"Why do all my bluetooth earbuds sound bad on windows? A while back I got a pair of galaxy buds 2 and they sounded great on my phone. Unfortunately I lost them and I got a pair of lg fp5s as a replacement and they also had pretty good audio quality, at least on my phone.

Every time I tried to connect my galaxy buds 2 to my laptop though, they would sound pretty bad. It wasnt really all that noticable when I was just watching a youtube video or talking on discord, but every time I tried to listen to music on spotify, the high end always seemed really noticably low quality. I dont really know what the thechnical terms are but it was like all the high frequency sounds were all distorted, and it really ruined the experience. Same goes for now when I try to use my fp5s. 

All the articles on the internet I've seen so far say to make sure that I'm in stereo mode, not hands free mode, which I did, and still the problem remains.

I take another Discord call later in the day, and suddenly the audio quality is *INSANELY low*. Best comparison I can make is like, a 2002 Flash movie.

Earbuds,"Wireless earbuds that fit like wired I am on the hunt for good wireless earbuds that are not big and bulky and heavy so I can actually wear them. The job I'm doing is an office job that requires a lot of moving, so the extra mobility of a wireless earbud is important. The problem is all wireless earbuds I can find have giant bulky things BEHIND the part that goes in your ear where all the technology bits are. I want something lightweight and streamlined so they don't hurt my ear. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/keo5mjmg1la81.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07ef1267b0b9f35b73e64a806b1ba5c23ae1620

The shape of these wired earbuts is a perfect design. The plastic doesn't flare out past the silicone that fits in your ear and the hard bit that goes down to the wire is not sitting directly on the cartilage. Those two things together make sure it doesn't irritate the cartilage. I have yet to find a pair of wireless earbuds without either a giant flared base that sits directly on the cartilage OR a frustrating hard bit that sits directly on the cartilage. 

I'd prefer something like this with the traditional silicone seal bit (rather than the weird slide thing that the airpods have) because it fits better and is softer on the cartilage. I have sensitive ears and a bunch of hard plastic on the cartilage is a nightmare. 

Anyone have suggestions? 

I hate those neckbands too because I only wear them in one ear so I can listen to music at work but still be alert to what is happening around me and the needs of the office. So if I'm only wearing one of those, it will get cumbersome as if I'm using wired earbuds quickly..",wireless earbuds fit wired hunt wireless earbuds big bulky heavy actually wear job office job requires lot moving extra mobility wireless earbud important problem wireless earbuds find giant bulky thing behind part go ear technology bit want something lightweight streamlined hurt ear b keo mjmg la auto f ef b b f b e b ba c ae shape wired earbuts perfect design plastic flare past silicone fit ear hard bit go wire sitting directly cartilage two thing together make sure irritate cartilage yet find pair wireless earbuds without either giant flared base sits directly cartilage frustrating hard bit sits directly cartilage prefer something traditional silicone seal bit rather weird slide thing airpods fit softer cartilage sensitive ear bunch hard plastic cartilage nightmare anyone suggestion hate neckband wear ear listen music work still alert happening around need office wearing cumbersome using wired earbuds quickly

Earbuds,"Looking for VERY Uncommon Features Hey folks! I am so glad that there is a community for earbuds here on Reddit. I sincerely hope y'all can help me out. I am looking for a pair of TWS earbuds but my use case seems to be very unique and there really don't seem to be a lot of products I've been able to find that would fit my needs. Here are the features I need:

* Independent function. I only wear one bud at a time so I'm not willing to use a pair with a master/slave relationship because then I am essentially paying for two and getting one bud.
* No mirroring. In addition to only wearing one at a time, I almost exclusively wear them in my right ear. This means that to be able to put them both to good use, they can't be mirrored. They need to be interchangeable.
* They must be LOUD! I use these mostly for biking and I listen to almost exclusively YouTube videos, podcasts, and audiobooks. this means that since I'm not really appreciating music or anything, they really don't need to be super great sound quality but I need them to be loud since I am typically listening very actively to my media.
* Price. I'm not going to be a huge stickler on this one but to avoid this having to be a thing I need every couple years when my previous one wears out, I was hoping to buy several pairs once I find a set that works for me. So I'm probably not going to be able to buy like 3 sets of $200 buds. That said, most of the higher-end ones don't have the independent function that I need so they mostly eliminate themselves.

Right now I am using the Kurdene brand S8 buds and would love to buy those again but much like my Losei buds from way back in the day, it seems that their newer ones are all lighter and SIGNIFICANTLY quieter. The buds I have are dying so I am looking to find another bud style that works and fits my criteria.",uncommon feature hey folk glad community earbuds sincerely hope help pair tws earbuds case seems unique seem lot product able find fit need feature need independent function wear bud time willing pair master slave relationship essentially paying two getting bud mirroring addition wearing time almost exclusively wear right ear mean able put mirrored need interchangeable must loud mostly biking listen almost exclusively youtube video podcasts audiobooks mean since appreciating music anything need super great sound quality need loud since typically listening actively medium price going huge stickler avoid thing need every couple year previous wear hoping buy several pair find set work probably going able buy set bud said higher end one independent function need mostly eliminate right using kurdene brand bud love buy much losei bud way back day seems newer one lighter significantly quieter bud dying find another bud style work fit criterion

* [Jabra Elite Active 75t](https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-active-75t) \- This was my first pair and I was hoping that they'd magically fit after years of wingtip headphones...they didn't.
* [Soundcore by Anker Life A1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KDZ2NZX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) \- Recommended on this sub, but would still fall out

I've been considering the [Jaybird Vista 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3G74MY/?coliid=I3W194DUV06J3L&amp;colid=EA2I2JLFAGS3&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im) (pricey with subpar reviews) or the [Bose Sport Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CJCTG6Z/?coliid=I3302KJUXBQ2WR&amp;colid=EA2I2JLFAGS3&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it&amp;th=1) (even more pricey), but was ideally hoping to spend &lt;$100.

Earbuds,"Light wireless earbuds like BeatsX? Hi, I've had 3 BeatsX over like 7-8 years and loved the simple, comfortable design and LACK of annoying 'smart' features and need for apps and shit, just plain wireless earbuds with decent sound. Half of mine stopped working and I'm looking for a replacement

I just got the BeatsFlex since the X was discontinued and was disappointed to see that they're a lot more cheaply made, chunkier, and have this dumb smart feature that pauses your music for you when they hang down (and you have to wait for them to register that they're in your ear again to resume) *dumb* imo. And even sound worse than my X. I'm returning them.

Anything else out there that

\-Does not have a stupidly chunky neckband or control pads- is light and slim like BeatsX.

\-Has no 'sporty' wings to on the earbuds

\-Is not 'true' wireless i.e. Not seperate earbuds, I want them connected with a wire so I can just drop it around my neck and not worry about losing them

\-Does not have any 'smart' features or apps at all, just plain multi-device functionality

It seems like these type of earbuds would be simple to find but it seems like they're not lol.

Earbuds,"Spinfits CP1025 for TWS Earbuds! (&amp; Comparison Against CP100+, CP360) **TLDR:**
If you're on the fence between Spinfit CP100+/CP360/CP1025 for TWS buds, I'd wholly suggest the CP1025s for the checkout cart. The comfort is sublime compared to the other two variants and it'll fit most charging cases. 

Only exception is if you absolutely know that your TWS will hurt if it's placed deeper into the ear, then the CP100+ is the better option.

The CP360 IMO is really a fallback option if your ears will hurt with deep(er) buds placement **and** if your charging case will most likely not accommodate the CP100+.

**Detail:**
Spinfits are great aftermarket eartips but they aren't exactly cheap either. With many models to select from, it can be difficult to choose with a tighter budget. I have 3 variants on-hand, the CP360s, CP100+ &amp; CP1025 and after trying them all. I think I can safely suggest the CP1025 as the most versatile &amp; value-for-cash variant for all-round use.

**The Issue:**
Many TWS out there are absolutely fantastic for their prices to bring wireless sound for mobile use. But a persistent problem for myself has always been fit. 

I had long disliked in-ear closed-style buds due to the 'goldfish bowl' effect of having your ears plugged, but for effective ANC to occur, this style is pretty much mandatory now. The fit on these though have always caused me trouble with stock tips. Either they do not stay in-ears or they clog the ears up very uncomfortably for longer durations.


**Enter Spinfits:**
Recently, after much online recommendations, I've taken the plunge on Spinfits and I do not understand why manufacturers do not collaborate more often with them for silicone eartips. The comfort of these are way better than any stock tips I've used.

The issue however, is that there are multiple choices of Spinfits to choose from &amp; it's not easy to tell at a glance on their value proposition.

**CP360:**
This is the variant that usually gets recommended for TWS buds, but I actually find this as the weakest compromise. It's not  tall enough to achieve a seal easily and it's not soft enough to give comfort for deep placement

What results is a weird middle ground where the buds need to be inserted deeper for the secure seal which increases the stuffy and clogged feeling as more of your ear canal gets occupied. It's still more comfortable than stock tips, but leaves more to be desired.

**CP100+:**
These are more advertised towards wired IEMs rather than TWS as some charging cases simply won't accommodate their larger size.

However, the CP100+ gives me the best and easiest seal out of all 3 variants. It's tall height also means I don't have to insert the buds as deeply to achieve said seal and allows the tips to actually ""spin"" at a better angle to fit my ear canals, providing wat better comfort than the CP360s

The passive noise isolation is superb even while reducing the 'goldfish bowl' effect from such in-canal design.

If it were not for the fact that several charging cases cannot accommodate the CP100+, it'll be my personal recommendation for Spinfits for TWS.

I've not tried the original CP100 variant, but from what I gather, the Plus uses medical-grade silicone for best results against skin irritations.

**CP1025:**
These puppies are a real nice surprise. Given that I didn't enjoy the CP360s as much as the CP100+, I thought I would be let down by the even shorter height that would necessitate an even deeper earbud insertion for the seal.

However, the softness and flexibility of the silicone really overcame the discomfort of deeper placement &amp; it's by-far the most comfortable of all Spinfits I tried. It really alleviates *a lot* of the discomfort of in-ear buds, whether wired or wireless, in the first place.

The tradeoff is that cause the silicone is thinner for the softness, it doesn't provide as effective passive noise isolation than the CP100+, but the ability to wear &amp; enjoy the tunes in way better comfort outstrips any little loss of noise isolation. The comfort of these really cannot be overstated which really brings new life in my use of TWS earbuds.

**Conclusions:**
If I can only choose one variant without knowing how Spinfits are in the first-place, then the CP1025 would be the safest recommendation in terms of versatility &amp; compatibility (except for AirPods Pro &amp; Galaxy Buds Pro, which needs the adapter also sold by Spinfit).

If somehow you absolutely need the max passive noise isolation from Spinfit silicone tips then CP100+ are the next option; CP360 if you can foresee that the charging case won't accommodate the CP100+.

Nevertheless, all 3 variants are good in their own right and use cases and above all, way more comfortable than any stock tips due to their ""spin"" design.

Earbuds,"Two issues I discovered after using the Realme Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds after just 1 day Hi everyone!

  
Two days ago... I unboxed the REALME Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds...Charged it up and started testing it....  
After using it for a day... I realised two issues

* The ANC OFF/ON control
* A compromise to a modern-day wireless earbuds basic functionality

**1) The ANC OFF/ON control**

In order to Toggle ANC ON/OFF, you need to do it before you play any music or watch any video.If you are listening to music or watching a video, you need to pause first, and then Toggle ANC ON/OFF  
which to me, is kinda troublesome because I didn't have such issues with other ANC wireless earbuds around this price range.But if you are someone who don't Toggle ANC ON/OFF frequently, then this is not really an issue.

  
**2) A compromise to a modern-day wireless earbuds basic functionality**

And that is the Built-in Microphone.I was able to use the built-in mic to record audio with my iPhone.I was able to use the built-in mic to record WA audio.But I cannot use the built-in mic for a normal phone call, which to me is a major compromise on a modern-day wireless earbuds' basic functionality.  
But if you are someone who will remove your earbuds before you answer a call and talk directly into the Phone's built-in mic, then that is not an issue at all.

  
So I hope that those of you who are considering to get the REALME Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds.... do consider the two issues I highlighted above.

  
CHEERS!

Top priority for me is comfort and stability/fit. I thought I'd found the perfect fit with the pixel buds but the right one wouldn't stay in. Good sound is great. ANC/ambient and decent call quality are nice to have.

Some that I've tried that didn't work out due to fit:

- Earfun (go way too far into my ear for comfort)

Earbuds,"Earbuds pair appears as separate devices I have been using a pair of SoundPEATS T2 for last couple months with no issue with an Android phone and with computers.

I made the phone forget the devices and pairing a new device again but still saw two new devices.

I tried resetting the T2 as per user manual, with five taps on both earbuds while in their pod. i saw the correct LED flashing but still see two devices in Android's pairing view.

I then used the computer to list existing devices and saw two ""addresses"" (not sure about proper name there, it's a 48 bit number listed as hex digits) whereas before I only had one. To be more clear I only ever had `6C:0D:E1:7D:D8:BA` and now have `6C:0D:E1:77:AB:2E` as well.

Earbuds,"Recommendations/guidance on earbuds for calls in noisy environments Hi all,

I have very little experience in buying earbuds, so I'm hoping for advice from someone who actually knows what they're doing :-).  I'd love a specific recommendation, but I'll take advice for how to search on my own.

I'm looking to buy earbuds with a mic that works well for noisy environments.  I'm not very picky about how well I hear the call; what I care about is that my boss doesn't realize I went out for a walk.  Is there a specific technology that I should look for, that narrows this down?

I also need them to be wired, because Bluetooth tends to flake out on me at the worst moments.  But it seems to me that some earbuds have detachable cables.  Is this a gimmicky selling point, or does this stuff actually work well?  Because it would be nice to be able to take the cables off when I don't need the high level of reliability.

Side note: in this type of situation, like the Sure Aonic 215 Gen 2 ([https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/earphones/aonic215](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/earphones/aonic215)), where the hell is the microphone located?  Because the website makes it kinda look like there's a mic both in the earbuds themselves, and also on the cable.  How does this work in practice?

And, of course, then there's the budget.  I'd like to keep it under $150, but I don't know if that's doable with my requirements.  So I'm open to finding out I'm naive and need to spend more to get what I want.

TL;DR: how do I find earbuds that meet these criteria?

1. Mic works well in noisy environments. (Are there specific technologies that help with this?)
2. Wired, but preferably detachable cable.  (Also, does this feature actually work well?)
3. Budget preferably under $150, but open to suggestions

\- They need a cord that connects the two earbuds. She walks to her fitness classes but doesn't carry a bag and needs to be able to toss them on a bench with her jacket when she gets to her classes. She's afraid of losing individual earbuds.

\- She rarely listens to music, so as long as the sound quality is \*decent\* she's okay.

H√° certas palavras que usamos de forma intercambi√°vel, tais como efeito e efeito, ou eficaz e eficiente. E, claro, √† primeira vista, eles soam e significam a mesma coisa. Mas o problema √© que eles n√£o o fazem. O mesmo se aplica aos fones de ouvido e [fones de ouvido](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultadores).  


Na verdade, s√£o um grande exemplo de palavras que podem ser descritas como ""semelhantes, mas diferentes"". O que, n√≥s acabamos de lhe dar um tiro na cabe√ßa? Bem, o fato de voc√™ estar aqui indica que j√° teve algumas d√∫vidas.  


N√£o importa se voc√™ encontrou nosso guia tentando encontrar os melhores [earbuds](https://jolypops.com/collections/earbuds) baratos ou procurando por fornecedores de fones de ouvido populares. O que importa √© que voc√™ quer saber como estes dois itens supostamente id√™nticos diferem. Voc√™ encontrar√° todas as respostas abaixo.

## Earbuds

O termo ""fones de ouvido"" √© usado para descrever um pequeno dispositivo de pl√°stico ou metal usado para ouvir m√∫sica ou outras fontes de √°udio. Os Earbuds tamb√©m s√£o conhecidos como monitores intra-auriculares e telefones de canal.  


Os Earbuds s√£o bastante populares, especialmente entre os jovens e aqueles que usam seus dispositivos para exerc√≠cio. Eles s√£o confort√°veis de usar e v√™m em todos os tipos de cores e formas. Neste sentido, eles t√™m muito em comum com os fones de ouvido e os fones de ouvido, mas diferem significativamente.  


A principal diferen√ßa entre fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido √© que os fones de ouvido s√£o usados dentro da orelha. Os fones de ouvido, por outro lado, s√£o usados por cima dos ouvidos. Uma not√°vel exce√ß√£o s√£o os fones de ouvido intra-auriculares, que s√£o basicamente protetores auriculares.  


Portanto, outra diferen√ßa importante entre os dois tipos de dispositivos √© seu design. Os fones de ouvido s√£o normalmente projetados para se adaptarem √† forma do ouvido, enquanto que os fones de ouvido n√£o s√£o. √â claro que h√° alguns brincos que s√£o feitos para caber na orelha, mas n√£o s√£o muito comuns.  


Uma das coisas que tornam os earbuds t√£o populares √© que eles podem ser com ou sem fio. Voc√™ pode encontr√°-los com fios que conectam ambos os lados do dispositivo (isto √©, esquerda e direita) ou sem nenhum fio.

## Auscultadores

os fones de ouvido s√£o pequenos dispositivos usados para ouvir m√∫sica ou outras fontes de √°udio. Embora sejam freq√ºentemente usados de forma intercambi√°vel com o termo ""auriculares"", e muitas pessoas pensam que significam a mesma coisa, isto n√£o √© exatamente verdade. Na verdade, h√° v√°rias diferen√ßas entre os dois termos:  


Primeiro, os fones de ouvido s√£o usados por cima do ouvido, enquanto os fones de ouvido s√£o usados dentro do ouvido. Portanto, o projeto dos dois √© diferente.  


Voc√™ pode encontrar diferentes tipos de fones de ouvido, tanto com e sem fio. Voc√™ pode encontrar monitores intra-auriculares projetados para uso esportivo e modelos mais elegantes projetados para uso di√°rio. H√° at√© mesmo alguns fones de ouvido que v√™m com tecnologia de cancelamento de ru√≠do incorporada para que voc√™ possa desfrutar da m√∫sica sem ser incomodado por ru√≠dos externos. Eles tendem a ser um pouco mais caros do que as vers√µes normais, mas valem a pena se voc√™ quiser ouvir m√∫sica sem distra√ß√µes do mundo exterior.  


H√° tamb√©m uma diferen√ßa significativa no pre√ßo quando se trata de fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido. Os fones de ouvido tendem a ser mais caros do que os fones de ouvido porque h√° mais tecnologia envolvida para faz√™-los funcionar corretamente, especialmente aqueles que s√£o sem fio.  


Isto n√£o significa que os modelos sem fio s√£o automaticamente melhores; significa apenas que voc√™ ter√° que pagar mais por eles. Entretanto, se o custo n√£o for um problema para voc√™, os modelos sem fio podem ser uma op√ß√£o melhor porque lhe d√£o mais liberdade de movimento e voc√™ n√£o precisa se preocupar em arrancar acidentalmente seus fones de ouvido durante seu treino ou atividades de trabalho.  


Fones de ouvido vs. fones de ouvido: Qual devo escolher?  
Os fones de ouvido com fio s√£o geralmente mais acess√≠veis do que os fones de ouvido, mas podem ser menos confort√°veis de usar por longos per√≠odos de tempo. Os fones de ouvido tendem a ter melhor qualidade de som do que os fones de ouvido, mas podem n√£o ser t√£o port√°teis ou confort√°veis √†s vezes.

## Vantagens de Earbuds

Os protetores auriculares s√£o compactos e f√°ceis de transportar.  
S√£o baratos, o que significa que s√£o f√°ceis de substituir se perdidos ou quebrados  
Voc√™ ainda pode ouvir o que est√° acontecendo ao seu redor quando voc√™ est√° usando o auricular  
Eles n√£o ocupam muito espa√ßo em sua bolsa

## Contras de los earbuds

Os Earbuds podem ser desconfort√°veis.  
Eles s√£o f√°ceis de perder ou quebrar  
A qualidade do som n√£o √© t√£o boa quanto os fones de ouvido intra-auriculares.  
√Äs vezes √© dif√≠cil encontrar um par que se encaixe de forma segura e confort√°vel.  
√â mais prov√°vel que voc√™ tenha uma infec√ß√£o de ouvido com fones de ouvido do que com fones de ouvido.

## Vantagens dos fones de ouvido

Com fones de ouvido, voc√™ pode ouvir m√∫sica com mais clareza porque eles cobrem todo o ouvido.  
√â menos prov√°vel que os fones de ouvido caiam de seus ouvidos.  
Algumas pessoas descobrem que s√£o capazes de se ouvir quando usam fones de ouvido, porque h√° menos ru√≠do de fundo do mundo exterior.

## Contras do fone de ouvido

Talvez voc√™ n√£o consiga ouvir o que est√° ao seu redor se os usar.  
As orelhas podem doer ap√≥s longos per√≠odos de uso.  
Os fones de ouvido s√£o mais caros do que os fones de ouvido, portanto, se quebrarem ou se perderem, custar√£o mais dinheiro.

## Em resumo

Em resumo, a principal diferen√ßa entre estes dois tipos de fones de ouvido √© que os fones de ouvido ficam dentro das orelhas, enquanto os fones de ouvido repousam na parte externa das orelhas. A prefer√™ncia pessoal e o or√ßamento entrar√£o em jogo ao decidir qual tipo se adapta √†s suas necessidades.",qual diferen entre fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido bn iz p auto db b c f c f f h certas

Earbuds,"QCY HT03 ANC wireless earbuds after using it for just 24 hours Hi all,  
I shared a new video on my personal thoughts about the QCY HT03 ANC wireless earbuds after using it for just 24 hours.  


Regular pairing with devices through the Bluetooth menu was fast and easy.  
But to sync it with the QCY app... crazy!  


The location of the touch control area, a flat surface on the stem (like AirPods Pro) is facing inwards. Therefore, my index finger had to ""dig"" in slightly in order to get to the flat surface.   


The usability of the ANC feature is weird as well. To toggle ANC on/off, I will need to stop the music/video first and then Toggle ANC on/off. if I try to toggle it while listening to music/video, it doesn't work.  
This is completely different from the ANC wireless earbuds I have tested.

Fast forward and thinking about returning the Buds Pro and getting the Liberty 3 Pros. So my questions are:

1) How is the sound vs the two? Is the bass there? How is the music and can you really hear if you know what I mean?

2) How is the 3D audio sound on the Liberty 3 Pros when listening to music and movies on like Netflix, etc...?

Earbuds,"I am losing trust in gamesky I didn't realize until last week that enacfire a9  was rebranded by a company licensing the name palm  and being sold for $100. Then I visited this subreddit and someone pointed out that when he mentioned this on gamesky's comment section, the comments were deleted.


Today I go to look and see the gamesky listed this pair as the number one pair under $100?

Literally a rebranded enacfire a9  that license the palm  and charges $70 extra as the best pair under a hundred bucks?  That's hard to believe on its own, but even if it's true, he has an obligation to explain to the audience that these are the exact same body as the a9.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that his deal with  whatever company is licensing the name palm  has included in a contract. Something of him not mentioning that.

I can't guarantee that but otherwise why would he deprive his audience of that information when you can buy the exact same pair for a third of the price on Amazon today??  If there is a difference in sound quality, explain it! 

I'm sorry but at this point gamesky is  a salesman more than a reviewer.  I know most of these influencers will say that these companies don't have final say over their reviews and that is true. But if you read these deliverable partnership agreements, they have less freedom than they like to admit to say what they believe.

Either that or he's just choosing to not mention this.  There's no way he doesn't know, because as others on this subreddit have mentioned he's been deleting comments that mention this.",losing trust gamesky realize last week enacfire rebranded company licensing name palm sold visited subreddit someone pointed mentioned gamesky comment section comment deleted today go look see gamesky listed pair number pair literally rebranded enacfire license palm charge extra best pair hundred buck hard believe even true obligation explain audience exact body find incredibly difficult believe deal whatever company licensing name palm included contract something mentioning guarantee otherwise deprive audience information buy exact pair third price amazon today difference sound quality explain sorry point gamesky salesman reviewer influencers say company final say review true read deliverable partnership agreement le freedom admit say believe either choosing mention way others subreddit mentioned deleting comment mention

Earbuds,"Earbuds Recommendation Looking to upgrade my Tws earbuds and just need some recommendations. I‚Äôve had Jabra 65T active for the past 2 years but I only used them occasionally. I started using them more in the past couple of months and found the sound a bit muddy and when I increase the volume the highs sound harsh and leave my ears ringing when I take them off. 

I like accurate and tight bass but not boomy or super punchy with clear high mids and crisp treble but not the piercing or sibilance kind. Overall neutral sound thats slightly on the warmer side. Decent or good soundstage is a plus too.

Earbuds,"Technics AZ60 review Hi guys,

Purchased these buds a week ago after doing a lot of research. Thought this short review might be useful.

1. Fit: They fit well and don't fall when walking. However, they are not secure enough for running or doing other activities as will fall. Also, they kinda hurt my ear cannals. Not sure if its because my ear cannals have a strange shape, or its me trying to push them as far as possible. Still trying to get used to them.

2. Mic quality for phone calls: phenomenal, so far. I am talking a lot during the day and used them for hours in different apps (whatsapp, viber, normal phone calls) and conditions (shopping centre, busy street, supermarket, indoors) and the other party were always telling me my voice is very clear and the background noise is minimal. They have a feature called Just My Voice which is on by default. It is only activated automatically when on a phone call or recording voice via sound recorder. It basically acts like a gate, blocking all noise that is below the set threshold and leaving speakers voice on. Works really well! Note that if you try to record a video or send a voice message via whatsapp, viber, etc, the Just My Voice feature won't work and there will be a background noise - it will only work during phone calls.

3. ANC: Its my first ANC earbuds so I can't compare with the others BUT it does work really well and blocks most of the noise considerably. I am happy with the results.

4. Sound quality: mids and highs are really, really good, but the lows are muddy and bass sounds like it is a little distorted. Playing with EQ doesn't help, it seems its a part of the sound signature or limitation of the 8mm driver. I would say they are not very good for bass heavy tracks. But mids and highs are very clear.

Ask me if you need to know more.",technics az review hi guy purchased bud week ago lot research thought short review might useful fit fit well fall walking however secure enough running activity fall kinda hurt ear cannals sure ear cannals strange shape trying push far possible still trying used mic quality phone call phenomenal far talking lot day used hour different apps whatsapp viber normal phone call condition shopping centre busy street supermarket indoors party always telling voice clear background noise minimal feature called voice default activated automatically phone call recording voice via sound recorder basically act gate blocking noise set threshold leaving speaker voice work well note try record video send voice message via whatsapp viber etc voice feature work background noise work phone call anc first anc earbuds compare others work well block noise considerably happy result sound quality mids high low muddy bass sound little distorted playing eq help seems part sound signature limitation mm driver say bass heavy track mids high clear ask need

Earbuds,"Should I buy the JBL Live Pro+? So a week ago, I ordered the JBL Reflect Flow Pro and the JBL 230NC to try them out. The Reflect Flow's hurt my ears or didn't fit good (tried all eartips and earwings) and the 230's were actually a good pick for me. The fit was great and they were quite comfortable! The sound was good, battery life, everything was good for the price. But since a few days the right earbud doesn't shut off randomly when I put both I the case. I tried everything: reconnecting them to my phone, checking if they didn't connect with the charging points, factory reset the buds, deleting the JBL app without succes... So, I'm thinking about returning these too. Then the JBL Live Pro+ seemed interesting to me. They seem similar to the 230's, but a bit better in everything. Although I have one concern. The eartips the Live Pro's come with look pretty shallow, comparing them to the tips that came with the 230's. And since the fit of the 230's was almost perfect, I question if these will fit as good as the 230's.

Earbuds,"I just bought blue tooth buds that I'm pretty happy with, but am finding I am also needing wired buds for some of my devices. Looking for recommendations. I picked up Tozo T6s, which have worked fine with my bluetooth devices; but it turns out my laptop and a few gaming consoles aren't able to pair with bluetooth audio. I prefer balanced sound and am really looking to stay around $30US. I'm hearing mixed reviews on KZs and Moonbeam Quarks which used to be somewhat of a standard for cheap wired IEMs. The main complaint I see with the Quarks is cable noise, and I move around a lot at my workstation which has swayed me away from them. I'm also wondering if there's some type of bluetooth dongle that would allow me to use the T6s I already have with these other devices at a similar pricepoint; mainly my laptop and TV. I should also mention that I have narrow ear canals; which were part of why I opted for the T6s. I could honestly go smaller as they are a little too snug even with the smallest tips they came with.  


I appreciate your time and suggestions in advance; it's reassuring to get advice from people that have likely used a lot of different products. The T6s were my first new pair of buds/headphones in general in probably 7 years.

Earbuds,"Final Decision - Need Advice Hi all, I have narrowed down my final decision to these 4: 1More Comfobuds Pro, Earfun Air Pro 2, Earfun Free Pro 2, and Anker Life P3. Below are my thoughts/concerns atm, please give advice.

(Background - I use earbuds for workouts, I don't really care about app support based on my experience with Soundcore Life A2 NC, and I care about sound quality, call quality and ANC)


1) 1More Comfobuds Pro

Positive:
- strong ANC
- good sound quality

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)


2) Earfun Air Pro 2

Positive:
- Wind noise reduction when in ambient mode, or so I heard (impt - cos I use ambient mode when I run)
- Good sound quality
- Good ANC

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)


3) Earfun Free Pro 2

Positive:
- good sound quality
- secure fit (ear hooks)

Concerns:
- not too sure about ANC/ambient (since the original Earfun Free Pro had rlly weak ANC/ambient, heard the new model is okay only)
- battery life a bit on the short side


4) Anker Life P3

Positive:
- highly-praised app(not that important for me personally)
- good sound quality
- good anc?

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)
- audio dropout issues ( experienced this with me Anker Life A2 NC, a bit scarred lol)

Earbuds,"Best true wireless earbuds in 50-100$ price range (200-400 z≈Ç) for fun sound, v-shaped with non-harsh trebles? Wassup,

I'm trying to find ""fun"" sounding TWS buds, preferably with warm sound. I just got TWS1 Pro and tbh I really don't like those, the trebles can get very harsh and it hurts my ears and while bass is quite realistic, I find it a bit lacking. I don't really like EQing too much, when the base experience isn't fun to begin with.

I like treble a bit more than bass, but I like warmer earbuds since bright ones sometimes make the sound a bit fatiguing to listen to and overall warm sound is just way more pleasant for me. I have M50X headphones and I really like them, while they are a bit muddy, I like their quite warm sound.

I listen to hip-hop, metal, trap etc.

As an alternative, I think of getting Soundpeats Sonic or maybe H1, or maybe even Huawei FreeBuds 4i if I really don't find anything good.

Earbuds,"My review of blue colored 1more Comfobuds pro  Hi there. first must say i'm no expert nor audiophile and i try to put my feeling in simple words. So i was using FIIL T1XS and nothing more serious before that. unfortunately i lost the charging case and after days of watching videos i found a good deal on ""blue"" version of CBP and got it. (you may ask why color matters? i'll answer that in a sec). i try to compare these to fiils.

**1. Build Quality**   
 its fine .. nothing premium nor cheap. i love the colors and the fact that it has a matt finish. also case is very pocketable but very slippery so be careful. on the other hand T1XS is glossy and case ""was"" not as pocketable and was making quiet a bulge.

CBP : 8.5/10

T1XS: 8/10

**2. Fit and Comfort**

its somehow subjective but CBP fits ""my ears"" wonderfully and is ""very"" comfortable. i've never had a buds this much comfortable that i could listed to music for hours without earache. these don't go as deep and wont make a suction feeling in the ear.  Also I feel eartips are pretty high quality. I have a sensitive skin and  fortunately these dont make any allergic reaction. 

T1XS on the other hand fit very good but unfortunately too much tight and make you feel a suction in your ears (at least with default eartips) also eartips aren't that high quality and make itching after a while and i feel pain after 2-3 hrs.

CBP 10/10

T1XS 7/10

**3. Sound Quality**

(there will be a but.. continue reading to the end)

First time i put these in my ears i was shocked (in a bad way) because based on reviews i expected something balanced and neutral. out of the box these are noticeably warmer than T1XS and low frequencies are more emphasized here. I mainly listen to metal and pop. electronic guitars sound pretty muffled here. bass is satisfying but not as tight and overall sound is not as clear as i'd liked. some minor details sound too warm and not clear enough. also soundstage is somehow intimate. on the plus side, vocals and instruments sound lovely and warm. you can hear instruments well seperated. and it never sounds harsh (trebles are controlled). also volume is reeeeealy high.

I have dolby atmos eq in my phone but no matter how much i played with frequencies i couldnt make them clear enough. But... i said in the begining there'll be a but..! if you go in the app and select ""POP 1"" EQ, it gets MUCH better. electronic guitars now have the liveliness that i like and i even like them more that T1XS because i feel they have more texture and warmth to them which i really like. also i boosted trebles in dolby atmos eq and now they sound much better. and i love the sound now.

T1XS on the other hand sound very clean and sharp (metal EQ in the app is my favorite). it can get a little harsh but you can eq them. also i really love the bass on these (more than on CBP) .. its very tight and kicks hard. i dont like loose bass (some may do). on the other hand after using CBP i feel vocals on T1XS are somehow thin dont have the warmth and body that CBP has.  

overal score after EQing them:

Bass:

CBP: 8.5/10

T1XS: 9/10

Mids:

CBP: 9.5/10

T1XS: 8/10

Treble:

CBP: 9/10

T1XS: 9/10

Sound stage:

CBP: 6.5/10

T1XS: 7.5/10

Details:

CBP: 8/10

T1XS: 8.5/10

**4. Call Quality**

no competition here. CBP is superb and T1XS is simply bad. no matter the environment, you can have an easy call on CBP

CBP: 9.5/10

T1XS: 4/10

**5. Features**

ANC and Transparency on CBP are good. ANC reduces low frequencies very good. but mids and highs comes through. Transparency sounds pretty good and you can have conversation easily.

CBP:  
ANC: 8/10 transparency: 9/10

T1XS: Transparency: 4/10

on the other hand CBP lacks gaming mode and i wish it had it.. because i like to connect my buds to tv (monitor) these work fine but if you look for it you can see there's some delay (about 50 ms) but gaming on mobile feels bad.. theres +300ms delay. 

**6. verdict**

I wouldn't like these if i'd got the black or white color. fortunately new EQ made the sound very pleasing for me. i only wish it had so much better sound stage and details where a tad cleaner.

these are very versatile. good sound, very good ANC and call quality, and good price. i got the blue color the same price as others but does it worth more ? i'd say yes for me.. i'm happy that i picked these .. cant imagine living with default of these EQ.",review blue colored comfobuds pro hi first must say expert audiophile try put feeling simple word using fiil x nothing serious unfortunately lost charging case day watching video found deal blue version cbp got may ask color matter answer sec try compare fiils build quality fine nothing premium cheap love color fact matt finish case pocketable slippery careful hand x glossy case pocketable making quiet bulge cbp x fit comfort somehow subjective cbp fit ear wonderfully comfortable never bud much comfortable could listed music hour without earache go deep wont make suction feeling ear feel eartips pretty high quality sensitive skin fortunately dont make allergic reaction x hand fit unfortunately much tight make feel suction ear least default eartips eartips high quality make itching feel pain hr cbp x sound quality continue reading end first time put ear shocked bad way based review expected something balanced neutral box noticeably warmer x low frequency emphasized mainly listen metal pop electronic guitar sound pretty muffled bass satisfying tight overall sound clear liked minor detail sound warm clear enough soundstage somehow intimate plus side vocal instrument sound lovely warm hear instrument well seperated never sound harsh treble controlled volume reeeeealy high dolby atmos eq phone matter much played frequency couldnt make clear enough said begining go app select pop eq get much electronic guitar liveliness even x feel texture warmth boosted treble dolby atmos eq sound much love sound x hand sound clean sharp metal eq app favorite little harsh eq love bass cbp tight kick hard dont loose bass may hand using cbp feel vocal x somehow thin dont warmth body cbp overal score eqing bass cbp x mids cbp x treble cbp x sound stage cbp x detail cbp x call quality competition cbp superb x simply bad matter environment easy call cbp cbp x feature anc transparency cbp anc reduces low frequency mids high come transparency sound pretty conversation easily cbp anc transparency x transparency hand cbp lack gaming mode wish connect bud tv monitor work fine look see delay m gaming mobile feel bad there m delay verdict got black white color fortunately eq made sound pleasing wish much sound stage detail tad cleaner versatile sound anc call quality price got blue color price others worth say yes happy picked cant imagine living default eq

Earbuds,"Sony vs Technics vs Soundcore vs Sennheiser I posted this as a comment, but making a post of its own so more people can benefit from my experience. 

I went around and tried out all the earphones I'd been considering, plus the Sennheiser Momentum 2 since the shop guy recommended it. They were really patient so I was able to listen to multiple songs and make WhatsApp calls to my wife to test out the sound as well as the mics. The mic test was done in the middle of the mall, in a very noisy environment with people talking, music playing etc. 


Sony WF-1000XM4: Great sound quality, great noise cancellation. Mic clarity was really good, but the mics let in noise when I was speaking. But they felt a bit heavy / large in my ears. 

Technics EAH-AZ60: These had the best sound quality of all the buds I tried, even better than the Sony's. The ANC was definitely worse than Sony WF-1000XM4. The mic didn't let any noise in, but voice clarity wasn't great. This was a bit surprising since I'd heard great things about their mics. Overall the worst mic amongst the buds I tried (not bad by any means). Fit was really good, they felt light and small.

Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro: You're right, they don't carry the Air 3 Pro. Sound quality was not very good. There was a lot of bass, but it was poor quality base, quite bloated. ANC was significantly worse than Technics EAH-AZ60. Mic quality was great, with good voice clarity as well as background noise suppression. The best mic amongst the buds I tried. Fit was good, not as nice feeling as the Technics, but better than the Sony's.

Sennheiser Momentum 2: This wasn't in my list of considerations, but the guy encouraged me to try these and said the sound quality on these is supposed to be quite good (and I'd heard them reviewed so). Unfortunately, I found the sound to be quite mediocre, possibly worse than the Soundcores. Since I didn't like the sound, I didn't bother to test the mic. I liked the fit, the second best after the Technics.

Overall, I think I will pick the Sony WF-1000XM4, since it is the best balance of Sound, Mic, ANC for me. I hope the long term comfort on these works out.",sony v technics v soundcore v sennheiser posted comment making post people benefit experience went around tried earphone considering plus sennheiser momentum since shop guy recommended patient able listen multiple song make whatsapp call wife test sound well mics mic test done middle mall noisy environment people talking music playing etc sony wf xm great sound quality great noise cancellation mic clarity mics let noise speaking felt bit heavy large ear technics eah az best sound quality bud tried even sony anc definitely worse sony wf xm mic let noise voice clarity great bit surprising since heard great thing mics overall worst mic amongst bud tried bad mean fit felt light small soundcore liberty air pro right carry air pro sound quality lot bass poor quality base quite bloated anc significantly worse technics eah az mic quality great voice clarity well background noise suppression best mic amongst bud tried fit nice feeling technics sony sennheiser momentum list consideration guy encouraged try said sound quality supposed quite heard reviewed unfortunately found sound quite mediocre possibly worse soundcores since sound bother test mic liked fit second best technics overall think pick sony wf xm since best balance sound mic anc hope long term comfort work

Hello,  
I  want to buy earbuds preferably around $50 to Max $100 CAD. I know I  wont get a great sounding ones but just it would be great it they have  good bass and does OK job for phone calls.  Could you please suggest me  some?

I also head that most of the  wireless earbuds suffer in making calls, even the expensive ones. In  that case would opt for wired earphones.  I am been considering these:

Earbuds,"Do you know of some nice earbuds that could satisfy these requirements? Hey there,

I am shopping for new earbuds this Christmas and I would really want to upgrade to some higher quality ones for a better music experience.

My price range is around 100-cca200 (if it's like 220 that's also ok but really don't wanna go much higher). 

I am mainly looking for something that's more towards mids and highs with a normal bass. When looking for earbuds I always had the problem of getting ones that amplify bass which then proceeds to overshadow vocals and essentially downgrade most of the songs for me (Right now I have JBL T210 and it's exactly that case). 

I usually listen to stuff ranging from AC/DC through indie, alternative, classical, rock instrumental to avici and more party songs but almost never to drums n bass, techno, electro etc. At the same time it would be great if the headphones can actually highlight the different instruments in the song without overshadowing vocals (The JBL T210 I have now does an okay job of highlighting different instruments and sounds in a song but really overshadows vocals at the same time).

I was looking into etymotic but I am also not a fan of the extreme sounds isolation where I can hear my heartbeat and every scratch of the cable at the same time. I would rather prefer the standard style of buds that can be found on the cheaper headphones where the sound isolation isn't extreme so I can still somewhat register what's happening around me.

I know its a lot of things but I have been searching for a while and really struggle to find something that would fit this, so if you have any advice on a pair that could satisfy these requirements that would be super cool.",nice earbuds could satisfy requirement hey shopping earbuds christmas want upgrade higher quality one music experience price range around cca ok wanna go much higher mainly something towards mids high normal bass earbuds always problem getting one amplify bass proceeds overshadow vocal essentially downgrade song right jbl exactly case usually listen stuff ranging ac dc indie alternative classical rock instrumental avici party song almost never drum n bass techno electro etc time great headphone actually highlight different instrument song without overshadowing vocal jbl okay job highlighting different instrument sound song overshadows vocal time etymotic fan extreme sound isolation hear heartbeat every scratch cable time rather prefer standard style bud found cheaper headphone sound isolation extreme still somewhat register happening around lot thing searching struggle find something fit advice pair could satisfy requirement super cool

The problem is that she is so... clumsy. She's around 60yo, and I'm a little bit concerned about the fact of being completely isolated about the sounds surrounding her may led her to some troubles. But every model I see these days is sold under the fact of ""being completely noise cancelling"" or similar, when I'm looking for exactly the opposite.

\- being relatively easy to connect and to use for an old person

I take great care of them and can't think of why they keep doing this. I recently got gifted a pair of power beats pro and they are already starting to show signs of breaking(In my experience anyway), disconnecting randomly(though not too often), and they occasionally don't disconnect or connect to my phone when I put them in or out of the charger. The only thing I can think of is that I use them quite a lot and, I listen to my music quite loud(I don't have the greatest hearing so I need to). Could either if those reason be why they always break? And if so or even if not what can I try to do to get them to last longer? It feels like I kill them simply buy touching them.

- Quick switch

- USB-C charging
- At least an above average battery life
- Microphone decent enough for video calls
- Water resistant enough for gym sessions and light rain

- ANC is nice but not necessarily important for me
- Wireless charging isn't important
- Stellar audio quality not important, as long as it's decent enough

Earbuds,"Wireless earbuds temporarily muffled sound on one side So I've had this problem on two separate pair of earbuds, and I am wondering if anyone has any idea what might be the cause of it.

The earbuds in question are Sennheiser cx 150 bt, and the Jabra elite active 75t.

Being that previously I only used cheap ( sub 20$ ) wired earbuds, I don't really know what is to be expected from the bluetooth ones, but given that both are from reputable brands I would at least expect for the volume to be balanced properly.

The problem is as the title describes that on both of these one side gradually loses volume until it is barely audible.

On Sennheisers I first started noticing this problem in about six months of using them and on Jabras I noticed it on my second week of use. I don't think the problem is with my ears, as when I swap the sides the same earbud is still muffled

The strange thing about it is that the problem ""fixes itself"" after I  charge them. I have noticed that sound gets muffled more often when the battery is low ( around 30% ), but it doesn't explain why is it only on one side. I guess I could understand with the Jabras as each earbud has its own battery, but the Sennheisers seem to share the same battery.

Does anyone else experience this with their wireless earbuds? is that just something that comes with the technology and how batteries work, or am I wrong in assuming that the battery is the problem? Should I return them?",wireless earbuds temporarily muffled sound side problem two separate pair earbuds wondering anyone idea might cause earbuds question sennheiser cx bt jabra elite active previously used cheap sub wired earbuds expected bluetooth one given reputable brand least expect volume balanced properly problem title describes side gradually loses volume barely audible sennheisers first started noticing problem six month using jabras noticed second week think problem ear swap side earbud still muffled strange thing problem fix charge noticed sound get muffled often battery low around explain side guess could understand jabras earbud battery sennheisers seem share battery anyone else experience wireless earbuds something come technology battery work wrong assuming battery problem return

Earbuds,"Technics EAH-AZ60 Review I was looking for a set of earbuds that had some specific features. 1) Could use either singly 2) Good mics 3) Multipoint 4) Good sound 5) Comfortable 6) ANC. I was coming from using a Master &amp; Dynamics MW07go set for reference. The sound quality is great, but that is about all they have going for them. Mics are awful and only the right one can be used independently.

The only earbuds I found that met the requirements were the Technics and the Liberty Pro 3s and maybe the Elite 7 Pros (if the update ever happened). Obviously the LP3 reviews were all great and it seemed like a great option, but I wasn't sold on the form factor or case size. Kept searching long and hard for reviews of the AZ60's and finally found 2 reviews of the Technics that had mic samples and was impressed enough I bought them from Amazon.

The Good

I've been using them daily for about 10 days now including a week of work and I love them. I have quite a few WebEx/Teams/Zoom meetings during the day and listen to audio from my phone a good part of the time I'm not in a meeting. This is why I wanted something with good mics and multipoint. I was switching between my earbuds and a dedicated BT headset (Plantronics Voyager 5200). As I've used them for calls, I've not had a single person complain or say I wasn't clear. I tested them vs the headset with a coworker on a call and they said both were good quality. You can also test the ""Just My Voice"" background separation in the app by listening to yourself with a delay. I turned some music up loud and then talked and the playback didn't include any noticeable background noise.

Sound quality is great and that is without LDAC enabled (enabling it eliminates multipoint). I do have the app set towards a high quality connection vs more stable connection but not using LDAC the majority of the time.

The earbuds are extremely comfortable and fit well in my ears. They don't feel like they are going to fall out and I don't feel like i have to keep adjusting them, they just stay put.

Multipoint works well and pauses the audio on my phone when I join a call on my laptop. 

The Bad

The capacitive touch for the ""buttons"" are  extremely sensitive and I find myself occasionally double tapping one when just trying to hit it once. I do prefer the physical buttons on the MW07 but its not a deal breaker on these and really is only a slight annoyance on occasion.

The Rest

Battery life seems to be as advertised. Single earbud use works as advertised. The case is small enough to carry around in a pocket and not notice it. As for ANC, it works but this is my first set with it so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I will keep the MW07go's around for yardwork or things that involve getting sweaty as they have a much better IP rating but these are certainly my new daily drivers.

Earbuds,"I have migraines related barometric pressure and recently started trying out earplugs to help (WeatherX, EarPlanes, etc.) but I want to know if there are earbuds out there that do the same thing but also play music? I'm new to playing around with these eat plugs and barometric shifts. I need to take note on what works and what doesn't. For example, I know I'm sensitive to increasing shifts, and this week the forecast says there's a steady increase in pressure that lasts a whole day, and I should try to wear them as much of the time that the weather is actively changing as possible, but that's a really long time to not be able to listen to regular earbuds. I'm talking, like, 16 hours. (I may find over time that I don't have to wear them the whole time, but again, I'm just playing around and taking notes at this stage, trying to avoid as many migraines as I can.)

I work a really boring job and listen to music and podcasts all day so I just don't think I can stand around with nothing to entertain me for a whole day while I have these awesome things in my ears, even if they seem to work great.

The alternative might be to wear over the ear headphones with them, but the reason I wear earbuds is because I'm so sensitive to pressure that I have never in my life found a pair of headphones that didn't over time feel like a vice on my skull, so I won't be likely to take that suggestion.

So, if anyone knows of earbuds that alter pressure like on an airplane but also play music, please let me know! I haven't been able to find any in my searches.

Earbuds,"Bose QC Earbuds Siri Prompt/Connectivity Issues I'm doing this more like a PSA because I tried googling my issues and didn't find anything about bugs or anything.

ANC was the most important factor for me in deciding my new earbuds and the Bose QC did not disappoint. The noise cancellation is amazing! I have a clicky g915 keyboard and I can't even hear the keys when I'm typing at my desk. 

But man it's really disappointing how buggy they are. The first time I paired them, I've had siri prompt at least 30 times without exaggeration. It was every few seconds. On top of that, my music or calls will keep randomly ending. I've tried fiddling around with options, updating the app, connecting through the app, bluetooth, both, etc and it got better. I found that connecting via bluetooth (not through the app) and turning off automatic ear detection really helped.

I will be returning these because siri still prompts out of nowhere in a quiet room. I was just on a zoom call and in the middle of my presentation it completely hung up the call. I had to log in to my computer and use my wired headphones to finish where I left off.

It's really unfortunate because these are so nice, but man. Has anybody else had these issues.

TLDR;

Bose prompts siri every few seconds and does a bunch of random functions. Fixed it temporarily with settings, but siri prompted and then hung up my zoom call mid-presentation so I had to use wired headphones.

I'm currently in search of my first pair of true wireless earbuds and regarding my needs and criteria I have retained the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and the OnePlus Buds Pro but I find it really difficult to chose one over the other.

From what I'v seen, they both offer more or less the same music and ANC quality, they both have around 5 hours of autonomy (w/ anc), they seem to be equally comfortable, they are around the same size and I like their design equally.

So here is my request : which one would you recommend me to buy and why ?

Here is what I'm looking for:
-Simple pairing process for either the left or the right to be worn individually
-Wireless earbuds with preferably no stem. If there's a stem it must be short.
-Waterproof - shower and occasional bath (they won't be submerged for any extended period of time)

Earbuds,"Disappointed with Earfun Free Pro? I picked these up last week and have mixed feelings, so would be interested to know how others have got on with them.

I got them on sale from Amazon after reading all the good reviews on here and elsewhere. I had been using a pair of SoundPEATS Truengine SE until they stopped working. I wanted something much smaller to replace them, and with the offer of ANC and ambient mode, the Free Pro seemed like a good option. But after a week i'm not sure i'll be keeping them.

The case is tiny, much smaller than i had expected, and fits easily into a pocket. The buds themselves are also probably the smallest i've seen at this (or any?) price point, and are very light. They fit well, and with the wingtips i feel no movement when out and about. I've not owned headphones with ANC or ambient modes before so can't compare, but the options are nice to have. Although i generally find i get enough passive noise cancellation with buds, so after testing them out it's not as big a deal for me as i had thought. The bass is loud / prominent (whether this is good or bad might be subjective... see below), and i generally don't have a massive problem with how they sound. Battery life is also good. 

However i'm finding the buds to be very fiddly to get out of the case, especially with the wingtips in... there's just not a lot to grab. There have also been a few times the buds have maintained a connection with my phone, despite the case being closed. I think this is due to them not being flush when put back in, so i really need to push them down to make sure they're secure. And while the buds are initial very comfy, i've experienced some ear fatigue after about 45 minutes to an hour. I'm experiencing the odd drop out too, lasting a second. It's not terrible, but last night i had about 4 drops in 30 minutes. 

Perhaps the most frustrating thing (before i get to sound quality) is the touch features. The right bud has a 2 second press for voice assistant. It seems very sensitive, and despite me having Siri and voice assistant turned off on my iPhone, pressing it still triggers the function. I have already accidentally called my landlord from 3 years ago, as well as a couple of distant family members i have no interest in talking to at midnight, despite me not knowingly saying anything particularly audible. Am i dumb or is there really no way to disable this?

Finally there's the sound. I know this is going to be subjective, especially because i can only compare them to the sound on my previous buds. I should also say i'm definitely not an audiophile. But i often find the bass to be quite muddy and even boomy, bleeding into other instruments rather than complementing them. Mids feel kind of 'loose'. I do listen to quite varied music, and find this experience worse with some styles / genres than others. I've subsequently picked up a pair of Anker's Liberty Air 2 and the sound comparison is pretty wild ( although i don't think the Liberty Air 2's sound that great either tbh).

Has anyone else experienced these issues? Am i just being unreasonably picky?

Also, can anyone recommend a similarly small pair of earbuds, preferably without stems, which maybe even have an app to adjust the EQ (and none of the issues above!)?

Earbuds,"WF-1000XM3 or Beats Studio Buds? Hello,

I've been trying to find some solid comparisons and I know these are different classes so to speak. XM3s are the top of line a couple years ago, Studio Buds are basically airpods with some ANC.  But right now, the price difference is fairly negligible, about $30 between the two (XM3 = $129, Studio Buds = $99).  Would love to hear opinions.

My priorities are, in order: fit &amp; comfort, use-case, sound and mic quality, and then case/battery

How comfortable are the Beats vs XM3s?  How well do they stay in?  I don't do much jogging/running, mostly walking. 

As for use-case...

I'm on iOS, which is the main reason the Beats Studio Buds are being considered. But other needs are gym use, work, and travel (via air). 

Work I wouldn't be on too many calls and I can be in a quiet area (I currently take calls using old apple wired headphones). 

Gym, I mainly do weights and calisthenics, very little cardio (my cardio comes from group classes where I couldn't even use earbuds anyways). 

Travel, mostly airports and airplanes. I'd like to drown out a ton of noise in the planes and most in the airport, but I'd like to still be able to hear when needed for alerts.

Sony's always been pretty solid for sound quality (I'm not an audiophile but I can def tell shitty sounds vs good sound) and, never owning Beats before, I've heard it's a lot more bass-heavy, which I don't care too much about. Noise cancellation, it's not a huge deal to me and I actually don't mind some noise (especially if I'm in an airport so I can be cognizant of any airline/gate updates)

The case/battery issues for me aren't as big of a deal since both have enough to last an airport trip and I wouldn't put the case in a pocket, more than likely I'd be having them on my carry-on or, if I'm going to the office, would be in a laptop bag. 

I'm leaning towards the Beats Studio Buds, but would like any opinions on why they would go for the XM3s vs the Beats Studio Buds.",wf xm beat studio bud hello trying find solid comparison different class speak xm top line couple year ago studio bud basically airpods anc right price difference fairly negligible two xm studio bud love hear opinion priority order fit comfort case sound mic quality case battery comfortable beat v xm well stay much jogging running mostly walking case io main reason beat studio bud considered need gym work travel via air work many call quiet area currently take call using old apple wired headphone gym mainly weight calisthenics little cardio cardio come group class even earbuds anyways travel mostly airport airplane drown ton noise plane airport still able hear needed alert sony always pretty solid sound quality audiophile def tell shitty sound v sound never owning beat heard lot bass heavy care much noise cancellation huge deal actually mind noise especially airport cognizant airline gate update case battery issue big deal since enough last airport trip put case pocket likely carry going office laptop bag leaning towards beat studio bud opinion go xm v beat studio bud

Earbuds,"Earbud recommendations for my mom? Unique situation. Some context: My mom is 60 years old and her tinnitus has worsened in the past year by a good bit. She's having trouble hearing certain voice tones now. She got examined by a nurse and was told that she would likely need hearing aids in the next two to three years if it continues to worsen at its current rate. Both of her parents had hearing aids as well in their later years, though idk if they had tinnitus.

My bf has tinnitus as well, but he literally constantly has an airpod in one ear playing music or videos to drown it out, even sleeping with it in. I was thinking of getting my mom some earbuds or headphones so she could listen to stuff while she works to drown it out, but she really doesn't like the feeling of earbuds or anything touching her ears, and headphones are even worse, so I'm kind of at a loss. I'm also worried about how she'll deal with a hearing aid in a few years as a result, but we'll see to that when it's time.

Does anyone have any recommendations for some incredibly comfortable earbuds? Like, ones that are very light maybe, so you can barely feel are there? 

If it helps to put a sob story as well for traction, my mom is genuinely one of the most hardworking, kindest people I've ever met. It's really not an exaggeration. She works 65 hours a week atm but that's the *least* amount of hours she's ever worked in her life - when I was in high school, it was around 90. She does an hour of exercise every single day - she used to do an hour and a half. She donates so much blood that every few years they tell her she can't anymore because she needs more iron, so then she eats a bunch of steak and takes iron supplements for a while and then goes back to it. She does charity work every single year. I've never heard her cuss or seen her drunk once. Point is, she's an extremely rare person, and it's not fair that she's done everything right and now her ears are fucking her up :(

Earbuds,"From CX 400 to CX Plus [Review] Hello!

I have only ever been using wired headphones and earphones until this spring. After upgrading from my 5+ years old Galaxy S7 to a modern phone, going TWS instead of dongles seemed like the smarter choice. Read some reviews and discussions, watched some videos, then finally settled on the CX 400 BTs from Sennheiser. Experiencing the simplicity of TWS for the first time was super uplifting and these earbuds way overdelivered on my expectations regarding sound quality. My plan was to use these for daily wear, commute, lounging etc, and get something cheap(ish) but IP certified for workouts. Even though these aren't very expensive or hard to find, and I'm just lifting weights and doing some cardio in the gym, I started to really appreciate these earbuds and didn't want to ruin them if they truly can't take a little sweat. Cheap but IP certified turned out to be Sony WF-SP800 when a very trustworthy retailer had them on sale for 60‚Ç¨. Pricing error or not, they delivered my order and I was anxious to try them out. Long story short, they aren't for me. Using the Sennheisers 2-3 hours a day then popping these into your ears, the difference in sound quality (and signature) won't go unnoticed. That was my smaller problem though, because what ruined the whole experience for me was the terrible fit. No matter how I combined the tips and wings, they just refused to sit in the right place, and because of this I can't really talk about their ANC (heartrough and smart pause worked well though). New plan was to keep using this suboptimal setup until Sennheiser comes out with something that combines their fit and sound quality with the features the CX 400 is missing to be an all purpose pair (for me anyway) and doesn't cost 250-300‚Ç¨. Well, more than half a year later here we are. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows, but after using the CX Plus for 2 weeks I'm very satisfied.

**What's better?**

* *Sound quality* is even better now. The 400s are a very balanced pair, but have a bit of a dreamy undertone that overshadows some details. The CX Plus makes the mids and highs crisper, that delivers a noticeable difference, especially in podcasts and audiobooks.
* Before using it, had no idea how useful and comfortable *transparent hearing* can be on your all purpose earbuds. With the 400s I had a choice between putting them back in their case like a good boy every time I had a small conversation, paid for my coffe etc, or clumsily shove one/both in a pocket. This makes things so much simpler and it's well executed as well (no weird tones, noises or directions).
* *Establishing the connection* after taking them out of their case is much faster. There's also mono mode which I don't think I'll ever use.
* Water (splash) resistance at *IPX4.* Nothing fancy, but one shouldn't be afraid to use these for regular workouts or in the rain.

**What's the same?**

* I still love how these *fit* in my ears. After a 4 hour train ride I wanted them out, but I think that goes for every deep silicone tip style design (at least the ones I've tried, wired or not).
* Charging and *battery life* didn't change based on my experience. Haven't done a 100 to 0 test with the CX Plus, but the 400s usually lasted about 6 hours on a full charge at 70-80% volume on the few occasions I commuted all day. Usually charge the case once a week.
* Making phone calls in windy or noisy (road) environments will still result in a lot of complaints thanks to their subpar *microphones.* They get the job done, but can be frustrating to both parties.

**What's worse or just plain bad?**

* Considering the perfect fit and passive isolation they provide (in my ears at least) this *ANC* is a joke. Ok that's a little harsh. This will definitely help you with quieting down the sound of keyboards in the office, or the constant humming of trains and commute in general. But this will do almost nothing when you try to lock out the gym's shitty music or want some peace and quiet in a cafe (chatter and cutlery). I don't have much experience with ANC, maybe this really is what people would call mid tier or good enough (based on the reviews I saw) but in my eyes this is barely more than a gimmick.
* Back in april I chose the CX 400 instead of the Galaxy Buds Pro because sound quality is the most important thing for me, and was ready to give up on some features I had no experience with (back then), including *wireless charging.* I'm not saying it's something super important to me, I don't even have a charging mat even though my S7 supported it back in 2016. But there were a few times when I forgot to charge the case and would have loved to use reverse wireless charging to top it off a little bit.
* Button is gone from the case that lit up the *battery level indicator.* Minor gripe, but I was hoping they would go the other way, and let us check battery status more precisely.

This is it basically. They're a really good, more sound than features focused all around headphones, and if you can get them for a good price (got mine for 100‚Ç¨) they will deliver on the value perspective as well. If not for the transparent mode, I'd say just go get the regular CX True Wireless, because it's a fair bit cheaper at retail and shares all the important aspects of the Plus model. 

Seems like Sennheiser woke up and realized there are some basic requirements and features people expect to be met at certain price points. Let's hope they will continue to refine them, because there are still a lot of things to improve.

If you have any questions ask away.

Earbuds,"Won't you please help me with my TWS ü¶Ñearbuds quest? I currently have Bose SoundSport Free earbuds -- I've had them for several years but, since last year, I've  basically been living in them. The declining battery life, therefore, is proving to be a real problem so I'm looking for the *right* second pair to switch to when they run out of juice. 

The Bose SoundSport Free are far from ideal but certain features they have are indispensible for the way that I use them -- I mostly listen to podcasts all day while I'm working, I often stream the news on my laptop, then movies and TV on the flat screen (hooked up to a Mac Mini) at night after my early bird husband goes to sleep. I switch between devices frequently.

Here's my feature wish list:

* Physical buttons or button-like controls -- no touch controls!
* Volume control, forward/reverse, call answer/end on earbuds
* Pairs to at least 4 devices 
* Ability to switch quickly between paired devices using an earbud -- no fiddling with disconnecting one device, then connecting to another device via settings or app!
* Low latency -- I'm not looking for perfection but it can't be so obvious as to be distracting
* Plays well with Macs and other Apple devices
* Rich sound / strong bass, fairly broad soundstage -- if they can be EQ'd to get the right sound, great, but a fancy app isn't necessary
* 5+ hours of continuous listening time
* Find my earbuds feature

So far I've tried and sent back:

* Sennheiser CX -- horribly uncomfortable for me, could never get the sound quite right (too quiet, too thin and treble-heavy), hate the touch controls, app was a bit messy, audio lag, extremely poor customer service, no quick switch between paired devices
* Beats Fit Pro -- no sound customization via app, USB-C to USB-C cable only, no quick switch between paired devices, must use Siri or app for volume control! Stupidly expensive for how little you get.
* Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro -- phenomenal sound and PNC, comfortable, app is great, audio lag, call sound quality very poor (left bud kept crackling and cutting out), hate touch controls
* Jabra Elite 7 Active -- decent sound with EQ in app, not super comfortable, app freezes/crashes alot/poorly designed, earbud design makes it hard to know when they're in correctly so the mic was sometimes pointed in the wrong direction and muffled my voice, case is very difficult to open and buds have to be turned around and flipped over to get them seated.

Despite their many flaws, at this point I'm close to just buying another pair of my old Bose clunkers, but I'd prefer to get something that's a bit more technologically and aesthetically up to date...

Earbuds,"Soundcore Life P2 Mini - A single tap away from greatness Convenience and comfort. That's what tws earbuds should embody. The P2 mini nail the comfort, but they lack the convenience by lacking volume control. Too many times I go to reach for one of my earbuds to raise or lower the volume - only to forget I can't on this pair. It frustrates me.

-

THAT said... despite this extremely obvious and avoidable deficiency, I can't help but reach for these time and time again. Mainly because they're comfortable, and they sound good. They're comfortable because they're compact and light, and they sound good because Soundcore knows what they're doing - except leaving volume controls off this earbud. 

-

Seriously, if these HAD volume control, I'd say forget anything else under $100 unless you NEED the more tech forward features and just buy these. It still boggles my mind that companies leave out one of the most basic functions of owning an earbud, but I guess product testing has deemed otherwise (I cannot fathom another reason for leaving out volume control). 

Beyond that, these are a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds, and I hope the trend of making smaller, more ergonomic designs vs packing in every feature possible becomes more viable. 

These are $20 at Best Buy in the US, and $30 on Amazon through Cyber Monday. YMMV if volume control kills it for you, but they sound good, they're comfortable, the charging case is actually good quality, and they're just fun to use. If that's all you need, I'd check these out.",soundcore life p mini single tap away greatness convenience comfort tws earbuds embody p mini nail comfort lack convenience lacking volume control many time go reach earbuds raise lower volume forget pair frustrates said despite extremely obvious avoidable deficiency help reach time time mainly comfortable sound comfortable compact light sound soundcore know except leaving volume control earbud seriously volume control say forget anything else unless need tech forward feature buy still boggles mind company leave basic function owning earbud guess product testing deemed otherwise cannot fathom another reason leaving volume control beyond fantastic pair cheap earbuds hope trend making smaller ergonomic design v packing every feature possible becomes viable best buy u amazon cyber monday ymmv volume control kill sound comfortable charging case actually quality fun need check
Earbuds,"Looking for Premium Earbuds. Longest battery life in a single charge with ANC on Hello good people, I will be updating from my awesome galaxy buds plus in the next few months. I am looking to buy a new premium pair that has the longest Battery life from a single charge with ANC enabled for working out only

money is no object, case size and additional case recharges are a bonus but not really a factor 

I listen at 40-50% volume with a maximum of 70% during really heavy attempts for hype 

Here's my list
1. Sony's WF-1000XM4 - 250$
2. Master and Dynamic MW07 PLUS - 200$
3. Jabra Elite 7 pro - 200$

Now here's where things get interesting, it's a bit of a long explanation so sorry. 

according to each company's website

the Sonys last for 8 hours with ANC (12 without).
The MW07 Plus lasts for 10 hours, and the Jabra 8 hours (no ANC rating)

Easy then, just get the XM4s right?

Well, I used reviews from 2 websites that I think are the best in earbud reviews from a thorough investigation point of view to see the quality of the ANC and battery life. 

Sound guys (they test battery life at 75 dB output volume) and Rtings (90 dB output) 

Let's get ANC quality out of the way first. 
According to sound guys, the only site that tested those 3 earbuds 
XM4 &gt; MW07 Plus &gt; Jabra (however Jabra has awesome isolation due to deep in ear fit) 

Unfortunately, the only common review between the 2 sites is the Sony XM4.

RTings should have the lower battery life since they test at a higher level. But they got ~11 hours with ANC on. Whereas Sound Guys got 7H45M as per Sony's claims..Which when compared to their reviews of the MW07 Plus (9 hours with ANC on) and Jabra Elite 7 pro (8H45M) makes me inclined to get the MW07 Plus instead of the Sony.. 

When checking both websites' galaxy buds plus reviews as a reference point for earbuds that I know how long they will last from actual usage. I saw the same thing. RTINGS lasted longer (13H30M hours vs 11H45M)

However, other reviews show expected results where RTings has the lower battery life, like the Anker Life Q35 over ear headphones 

I'm more inclined to believe the Sound Guys reviews more. However I think that their Sony review has something wrong with battery life testing, Perhaps a feature that wasn't turned off like the always on ambient awareness that recognizes if someone is talking to you and turns on ambient mode, or 3D audio, or they used the LDAC Codec

When I have the Headphones option selected I get no sound from whatever game I'm playing, nor can I use as a mic, but I can turn volume up, change sound profile etc by tapping on the earbud itself. When I use the Headset AG-Audio option I get sound from my game and can talk with my friends but I'm no longer able to control volume by tapping the earbud or change the sound profile. Which seems dumb because these boast having the Hypersync Low Latency feature but I can't even turn it on for a game......

Others say 250,- and still not that great. Often reviewers focus on one quality but never on practical use over a longer period of time.


Currently the Jabra elite 75t is 89,- for black friday. 85t's are 149,- which is an insane price jump, just as the difference between the QCY and the 75t's is insane. And even considering wired options are often great as well and so much cheaper.

Earbuds,"Earbud recommendation request I am looking for a wireless earbud recommendation.

I am coming from using Monster Achieve 100, but they got ran over by a car after the case fell out of my pocket.

It would mostly be paired with a phone, sometimes a tablet. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. 

Budget is around $100CAD, but I'm willing to reach $150CAD if the leap is warranted.

I'm looking to keep the Achieve 100's style and fit. That means I don't want the long stem style you see in products like Airpods or Anker Life P2 (I have the P2's and I don't really like them). 

Main thing I listen to are podcasts, but I also listen to music on occasion. Various rock, rap, hip hop, hell I sometimes throw pop in there if I'm feeling it. 

What I am looking for, in order of importance:

Most important would be the shape. I want it similar to the Achieve 100's as in I want the little (fin?) that holds the earbud in place. I don't want to scramble trying to grab a fallen earbud. I MIGHT be able to he swayed towards the shape of say the Soundcore Liberty 2/3 pro or galaxy buds, but I don't how much about their fit.

Just as important, I want to be able to have the option to wear ONE earbud. Specifically the left earbud. This would be in an office environment. I bought the Jabra Elite 75T after a month of research, and it turns out they only support dual earbuds or right only. No option for left. I never knew this could be an issue. I tried to work around that by turning both buds on and leaving the right ear out, but I guess the right bud is programmed to pause audio when taken out. Definitely returning the Jabras.

As a given, of course I want good sound. Doesn't have to be Bose Quietcomfort or Sony WF-1000xm4 quality, just something enjoyable.

Next, I would prefer Active Noise Cancellation or at least superb isolation. I have a roughly 40 minute commute if you combine bus and light rail. Doesn't need to be amazing, but I definitely want to notice the effect and don't want the hissing sound you can sometimes find. 

Features that would be an asset, but aren't a complete deal breaker, are:
Mobile app support (eq, settings, etc)
USB C charging (I don't necessarily need wireless charging)
Some form of water protection (IPX4+)
Pass-through sound. Sorry if I got the term wrong. I'm talking about a mode that allows you to hear your surroundings when necessary.


Call quality would be nice, but if the other features are present, I can live without amazing call quality. All I need is ""acceptable"".

So I've had the kz zsn Pro x for a while now and these are probably the best sounding earphones/headphones I've used. I've really grown to like their voice nad no matter what pair of TWS I pick they don't sound as good to me.

I tried a friends galaxy buds 2 and found them lacking.

What I'm looking for is something that sounds good. Mic quality doesn't matter as much but would be an added bonus (I don't want it to sound too bad   atleast good enough for semi quiete environments)

I've considered the FIIL T1 lite (I don't care much about features like ANC so didn't want to buy the pro) or the kz zsn Bluetooth module (the new one with Bluetooth 5.2 and apex HD support) but I've heard bad things about kz when it comes to Bluetooth like disconnects. So If anyone has this module an input would be appreciated!

My price range is about $50ish but if a TWS is under $100 and worth the price idm getting them.

Earbuds,"Help deciding between Bose QuietComfort and WF-1000XM4 Having one hell of a time deciding between these two buds.

ANC is important to me, and I'm fairly confident in both of these.  
Sony's likely will have better sound quality, but I know I'll be happy with the Bose too.  
Those are non-issue.


It really comes down to 3 main issues,

1. My ears suck. Most earbuds cause my ears to hurt within minutes. I hate it. However I own a pair of wired Bose earbuds and the Stay Hear Ultra tips are fantastic. I can wear them for hours with absolutely no pain.  
This makes me lean towards Bose. I'm afraid the XM4s will hurt.

2. The QCs have a huge ass case. For the times I'm travelling this isn't an issue, I'll have a bag with me - however if I'm just out walking around I don't bring anything with me and it looks like it wouldn't fit in my pocket comfortably, especially if I have keys/phone/etc in there.  
This makes me lean towards the XM4s.

3. This one is the least important, but still worth mentioning.
The XM4s are $349 CAD and the QCs are only $279.

  
  

Does anyone have similar ear comfort issues and have tried the XM4s?   
Were they comfortable?

The JBL's have some impressive features: high water resistance, high battery life, good sound quality and a lot of eartips/wings.

The LG's in the other hand: UV for killing bacteria, (for what I have seen and heard) great comfort thanks to the design and medical silicone eartips, the case can be used as an audio/bluetooth transmitter, decent battery life, good enough water resistance and good sound.

The thing is, the JBL one's look the best option for me, but I'm a bit worried about the fit. I don't know if these will stay comfortably and secure in my ear when working or doing nothing, because of the big size and the weight. On the other hand, the LG one's look like a great option too, but I can't judge if I will like the sound and the fit as well.

Earbuds,"Wireless earbuds advice So, earlier today my Jabra Elite 65t case broke after 2.5 years of intensive usage. After some debating with myself and blackfriday coming up I've decided to buy a new pair of earbuds.

I've been eyeing the Sony wf-1000xm4 for a while now for their noise cancelling and form factor, but I'm unsure if they're worth the extra 100‚Ç¨ from the Jabra Elite 85t, a pair I know I'll most likely end up loving anyway due to their form factor and similarities to the 65t.

Does anyone know how much the 100‚Ç¨ price jump would be worth it for the Sony's, or perhaps someone has any other recommendations for me? I use earbuds on a daily basis in both public transport and for usage at home.

Earbuds,"Looking for earbuds when I'm training The workouts I usually do is Gym and Running.   
I have owned Jaybird X4, Jaybird Tarah Pro and I have tried working out with the Jaybird Vista.  
The Jaybird X4 didn't get a good fit at all in my ears, but When I bought the Tarah Pros I got very happily suprised because they did fit perfectly in my ears. The Jaybird Vista fits okay I guess in my ears. But when I really sweat or run for a long time they get a bit loose which is very annoying.

Now I'am looking for Truly wireless earbuds

Important features:

\-  The most imporant thing is that they fit very well in my ear like the Tarah Pro did  
\- They need to block out much sound so that I don't get annoyed in the gym  
\- The Sound should be pretty good  
\- They need to be able to connect to a training watch like the Garmin 245 Music  
\- They need to have volume controll and skip song  
\- Atleast okay battery life  


Things that don't really matter  


\- I don't mind a big case but a small one would't hurt  
\- They don't need to be good at calls

If I don't find any Truly Wireless Earbuds that fit well, Then I will buy the Tarah Pro again but I really want truly wireless ones :D

Would appreciate any form of advice :D",earbuds training workout usually gym running owned jaybird jaybird tarah pro tried working jaybird vista jaybird fit ear bought tarah pro got happily suprised fit perfectly ear jaybird vista fit okay guess ear sweat run long time bit loose annoying truly wireless earbuds important feature imporant thing fit well ear tarah pro need block much sound annoyed gym sound pretty need able connect training watch garmin music need volume controll skip song atleast okay battery life thing matter mind big case small hurt need call find truly wireless earbuds fit well buy tarah pro want truly wireless one appreciate form advice

Earbuds,"Earbuds recommendation with good mic for call &amp; ANC Hi everyone! May I ask for recommendation or advice on a good pair of earbuds with (1) good mic that can reduce background noises, &amp; (2) ANC - although this is not the main priority.

I'm still okay with the noise, since I got help with my current earbuds (Sony WI-C300 &amp; JBL Endurance Run). Unfortunately, they don't bode well for online meetings as the construction noises would disrupt my call input. Although I can hear the other meeting attendees well, they might not or ended up just hearing the construction noises.

Earbuds,"Any sub 100 USD earbuds that can deliver similar sound quality to Sennheiser 350bt headphones? Hi all,

I tried posting this question over at r/headphones, but it got removed so I'm hoping to find some answers here instead.

I'm not an audiophile and I'm more than happy with my Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, but they are not ideal for running in, so I'm looking to buy some earbuds that sound just as good but for around 80 USD max. They do not need to be noise cancelling, have super long battery life, etc.  Just as long as they are BT earbuds and not have any cords.

Anyone here with personal experience / expertise in the matter?

Earbuds,"Had to get rid of my Galaxy Buds Pro due to allergic reaction, what are my best alternatives? So after dealing with months of unexplained ear infections it was determined my beloved Galaxy Buds Pro were the cause.  I am currently trying out both the Jabra Elite 85T and Anker Liberty Pro 3's but so far neither are meeting my needs as much as the Galaxy Buds Pro did.

For reference my hearing is subpar so audio quality is less important as fit, good ANC, good transparency mode, and a good mic for call. Multipoint is also important as I am constantly going back and forth between my Samsung phone and tablet.  Wireless charging is ideal but if I had to give it up to get everything else I could live without it.

Based on those requirements I slightly prefer the 85t's as at least for my ears the fit is more secure and transparency mode is better (although still not as good as the Galaxy Buds). ANC seems about the same no both but the mic is much better on the Liberty's plus it handles wind noise much better than the 85t's (although again not as well as the Galaxy Buds)

I also feel like the Liberty's are a bit unpolished with the current firmware. I have lots of issues where I will take them out of the case, put them in my ears and only one bud will work which requires me to fiddle with it to get it to activate. I also hate the amount of gymnastics it takes to get them in and out of the case correctly.

Are there any other buds based on what I am looking for that I should consider?  I have heard the newer Jabra Elite 7 Pro's have a better mic than the 85t's but I am also hearing the current firmware is buggy with poor ANC and no Multipoint yet.

Earbuds,"Looking for ANC buds with specific requirements for live band Hey folks, i thought maybe i might have some luck posting to this community after coming up short elsewhere. 

Im a musician singing in a medium loud two piece band (guitar and drums). My hearing has been damaged over the years playing full time in more than medium loud bands and as a result im desperately trying to cling on to what hearing i have left. 

Ive used all sorts of ear plugs over the years including custom molds, and ofc they all suffer the problem of giving you the boomy headvoice that ruins your experience as a vocalist. 

Finally i started using Bose QC 25s to jam and wow they are perfect. The eq profile they attenuate removes all the low mid mud and leaves softened but clear mids and highs, without any headvoice, so i can monitor my mic control and hear the room as if i werent wearing hearing protection. They occasionally clip but not enough to be a big deal. Im hoping 7 or so years of ANC tech has made things better in this regard. 

So unfortunately although they are perfect in the auditory sense, the look of wearing headphones on stage is a deal breaker. Im hoping that there are some earbuds (preferably cheap) that have exceptionally strong ANC and that are ported like the airpod pros to eliminate the headvoice. Sound quality literally doesnt matter, i will only be using them as battery powered earplugs. Bonus points if theyre wired, as i could then use them as IEMs. I hate the foam tips on my IEMs and cant ever get them into my ear canals, i need a small silicon tip which defeats the purpose unfortunately.

Earbuds,"Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Ramblings  Pros 

* Sounds is good, great clarity and bass, bit piercing high end
* Good ANC
* Firmware updates shows improvement commitment 
* Good mic

Cons 

* ANC feels dirty in loud environment
* Puttings buds back in case is difficult 

Soundcore liberty 3 pro (Firmware 4.58, L3P) is a great earbud but comes with some serious downfalls for me. The earbuds have a sleek case that is pocketable, good for carrying around. However to wear the buds, you need to rotate the buds 180\* degree before putting into your ear, this is still ok as you can get the hang of it. Putting back the earbuds is a different story, its feel really unintuitive to take your earbuds out, rotate it 180\* then put it back. Not really suitable for storing earbuds on the go and storing these becomes a really deliberate action. 

The sound quality is pretty good with the earbuds. I have a bad ear for identity sound quality and will try my best here. Vocal and bass is good, bass is really heavy and clear, vocal clarity is clear for wireless earbuds. However, high ends sometimes feel sharp and piercing, which could be fixed with custom EQ. 

HearID ANC works in L3P. Using Android‚Äôs soundcore app for HearID, it requires the mic access only when HearID is running. I think that it's using the phone app alongside the earbuds to do some tuning for the ANC. The ANC works well in a normal environment, better than AirPods Pro in some situations. In a loud environment the ANC is able to tune down the noise, but at the same time it feels like it's casting a layer of thin white noise for the ANC to work. This approach just makes the ANC feel dirty when it's used in a loud environment like during my bus commute. 

Earbuds have been used for 3 days and already received 2 updates, one out of box, and a recent one that fixed the previously lousy mic. Regardless, I will put this for sale, it's a great buds but the difficult storing and the dirty ANC make it not suitable for my commute purpose.

Ok so I bought new earbuds since the soundcore liberty air 2 pros I bought the last time hurt my ears and didn't wanna fit well, tested these edifiers for half an hour and couldn't tell if they're better, they seemed more comfortable, and they prolly are, but wearing them half an hour already brings my ears fatigue ü•≤ü•≤ idk I guess it's the airpods form that I don't like (with this stem), before that I only had round earbuds like Xiaomi airdots and they were pretty comfortable for my ears but well.. 

-- SOUND 
so when I tried these earbuds the first thing I noticed right away was that the sound quality was not that much different than the soundcores, dynamic mode was on by default but to me it sounded kinda artificial so I put them on classic mode and now they sound almost exactly like liberty air 2 pro (to my ears). And this is good sound quality, everything is balanced I literally get goose bumps, even bass is fine (although I don't really like too much bass, so the songs I listen to are usually acoustic) they do mix stuff when there's too much going on in the song but I guess that's ok

-- APP
But what makes them different from the soundcore earbuds is this absurdly stupid app. First of all it keeps asking for the permission to work on top of apps - I have no idea why. Secondly it has this stupid panel in the notifications panel (I personally hate to have anything permanent in my notifications panel) and they don't provide any setting to turn it offü•≤ so I had to disable it via android os tools. The app itself looks like they made it yesterday in a hurryü•≤ u can see I'm not lying if you check its rating on Google play store üòÖ it's really such a contrast when u first get the earbuds and their packaging is pretty good, they even include a bag for the case, but then u download the app and now u look like u just bought a pair of 3$ earbuds but paid 100+$ for them ahah 

-- ANC
honestly anc on these earbuds seems a bit stronger than on the soundcores, the soundcores they kinda have this hiss and u wonder what's the point of replacing the ambient noise with this hiss the earbuds themselves produce))) with these there's also a bit of noise present but they're still a bit better I think.

So in the end I wasn't really impressed by these earbuds and I'm not even an audiophile who's pampered by awesome expensive earbuds, these are only second earbuds that I'm buying within the same budget.. what turned me off was the app firstly, secondly I expected a lot better quality than from the soundcore liberty air 2 pros but nope, also these stupid voice lines every time you change a mode are so annoying, and there's no way to turn them off üòÖ 
Would I personally recommend them to anyone? No way. Their sound quality is ok but the user interface is laughable, they act like cheap earbuds from Ali, like those counterfeit earpods you can buy lol but that's only my take on it, someone more experienced like El Jefe would prolly have a more educated opinion on this üòå",edifier neobuds pro sound quality laughably bad app preface ok bought earbuds since soundcore liberty air pro bought last time hurt ear wanna fit well tested edifiers half hour tell seemed comfortable prolly wearing half hour already brings ear fatigue idk guess airpods form stem round earbuds xiaomi airdots pretty comfortable ear well sound tried earbuds first thing noticed right away sound quality much different soundcores dynamic mode default sounded kinda artificial put classic mode sound almost exactly liberty air pro ear sound quality everything balanced literally goose bump even bass fine although much bass song listen usually acoustic mix stuff much going song guess ok app make different soundcore earbuds absurdly stupid app first keep asking permission work top apps idea secondly stupid panel notification panel personally hate anything permanent notification panel provide setting turn disable via android o tool app look made yesterday hurry u see lying check rating google play store contrast u first earbuds packaging pretty even include bag case u download app u look u bought pair earbuds paid ahah anc honestly anc earbuds seems bit stronger soundcores soundcores kinda hiss u wonder point replacing ambient noise hiss earbuds produce bit noise present still bit think end impressed earbuds even audiophile pampered awesome expensive earbuds second earbuds buying within budget turned app firstly secondly expected lot quality soundcore liberty air pro nope stupid voice line every time change mode annoying way turn personally recommend anyone way sound quality ok user interface laughable act cheap earbuds ali counterfeit earpods buy lol take someone experienced el jefe prolly educated opinion

Earbuds,"Stem design or earbud? Best option for 60 dollar bracket I'm torn between making a choice between stem styled or bud styled tws. Having surfed the internet for quite some days now made me even more confused.
Personally I'm biased towards stem styled tws in that they look like you mean business and could work even in formal settings unlike the bud styled ones which are rather sporty.

I have my eyes on a number of tws in each price bracket but haven't been able to commit to one. Initially it was about just having a pair in 30ish dollar but delving into the market and the variety of products made me push my budget and search for the best bang for the buck . 
Here is my carefully crafted tentative list in each price category :

30$ ish : FIL t lite , edifier tws 1 pro ,

40$ ish : sound peats te3 se, sound peats sonic 

50-60$ ish : ear fun free pro, FIL t1 pro , sound peats h1, flybuds c1, sound core life p3

Even willing to explore the 70$ ish bracket if it offers a more comprehensive product.

My major dilemma with this is that I I want everything in the product that I lay my hands on to. Comfortable and secure fit(not too bulky), good battery life, low latency, pocketable case, preferably an app support,clear mics and a balanced sound signature with emphasis on mids and vocals and a bass that hits deep with a thump and rumble but at no point becomes too bassy or muddy or too piercing and has enough air to it and proper instrument separation. 

Suggestions and arguments would be welcome on this thread.

Earbuds,"Need a replacement for my EPH-100SL So after many years, one of my EPH-100SL ears is starting to fail. I had a spare, but I gave it away to a friend. Thankfully, it isn't completely dead yet, so I can still live by tweaking the balance. I can't seem to find a new pair of EPH-100SLs to ship here timely (Canada). I do have a newegg pair that might get here, but it'll take a month.

Do you guys have a cheaper recommendation that might tide me over, in case this pair dies completely? I'd also like it as a backup. I'm not an audiophile, but I do prefer the sound profile I get from these earphones from many other similarly priced options I tried years ago.

I wasn¬¥t using my soundpeats Sonic earbuds for around two months. Now it seems that the charging case does not do anything. No LED light, no reaction to USB connection or bud insertion.

I always manually switch off the earbuds so the buds itself are working fine and are fully loaded, but it seems the charging case discharged itself during this time completely to a point where the internal li-io battery is just dead ( I know that if the voltage of those batteries falls below a certain point they are dead and cannot be recharged...). 

So what now? Is this a warranty issue or ""my own fault""?

Earbuds,"Every truly wireless pair I‚Äôve tried just sounds worse I‚Äôve been using pretty cheap pairs of wireless headphones that are connected by a wire, such as the Otium Wireless IPX7. They serve me fine, but I‚Äôve been trying to make a switch to truly wireless headphones for a while. For a variety of reasons, but not having my headphones tangle up with my mask when I want to take one or the other off would free me of most burdens in life. 

The problem is, and this is driving me crazy, every pair I‚Äôve tried just sounds terrible in my ears. The sound comes through muffled, it‚Äôs clearly harder to distinguish different instruments in music, and the volume never seems to get nearly as loud as my ‚Äúwireless but with a wire‚Äù earbuds.

For context I‚Äôve most recently tried the Earfun Free 2 and Jabra Elite 75t, as well as 1-2 a while ago that I can‚Äôt remember. Now based on the reviews for these pairs and everyone else‚Äôs experience, it‚Äôs obvious my $20 earbuds don‚Äôt just magically deliver better sound quality, but something must be going on because the difference is quite stark to me (and not in a positive way).

My main suspicion is that my ear geometry is just not compatible with these earbuds for some reason. The truly wireless earbuds I‚Äôve tried all sit in my ear in a specific way that other earbuds don‚Äôt. They feel like they‚Äôre lodged in place and sitting deeper in my ear. 

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything through Google, so I wanted to check if anyone in this community has had a similar experience and/or can recommend a pair of truly wireless headphones that may fit differently.",every truly wireless pair tried sound worse using pretty cheap pair wireless headphone connected wire otium wireless ipx serve fine trying make switch truly wireless headphone variety reason headphone tangle mask want take free burden life problem driving crazy every pair tried sound terrible ear sound come muffled clearly harder distinguish different instrument music volume never seems nearly loud wireless wire earbuds context recently tried earfun free jabra elite well ago remember based review pair everyone else experience obvious earbuds magically deliver sound quality something must going difference quite stark positive way main suspicion ear geometry compatible earbuds reason truly wireless earbuds tried sit ear specific way earbuds feel lodged place sitting deeper ear anyway able find anything google wanted check anyone community similar experience recommend pair truly wireless headphone may fit differently

Earbuds,"My Terrible Experience with Mifo Audio (Canada) Preface, I have literally never returned anything I have bough online, even clothes I have bought that don't fit or I didn't like, I just stomached the loss usually due the high cost of shipping it back (also a bit lazy). This was my first time returning/warrantying anything, and it was a horrible experience.

TLDR: Order earbuds on August 27, 2021 with express 2-day shipping for an extra $23.50, received broken earbuds 6 days later. Dealt with horrible, insulting, and  slow customer service that finally accepted my warranty on September 20th that I had to pay an extra $20 to ship back. Finally received my ear buds 74 days after purchase on November 9th.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to buy a pair of Mifo O5 plus from [mifoaudio.ca](https://mifoaudio.ca), after doing research on several pairs. My decision was made due to their high battery life in the case, as well as good customer service reviews. 

My order was placed on August 27th, and I paid an extra $23.50 for express 2-day shipping since I was heading on a back country hike on September 1st, and bought these for that specific hike. It arrived on September 3rd, 6 days after the purchase date. I wasn't too upset at this as I requested a refund on the express shipping which was finally approved after several frustrating emails back and forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this was the end of it, I would still have left a 4/5 star review. However, the left earbud never even turned on. The instant I took it out of the box, the left earbud never had any power, never played a single second of music, and never charged. Of course, I charged the earbud case, I ensured the earbud was in contact with the charging lead, and nothing happened after a couple hours of charging.  

I instantly sent Mifo an email about this, which I was sent a response with steps on ensuring the earbud is properly charging, to clean the contact leads, to reset the earbud, to ensure Bluetooth connection, etc. I followed all the steps, and ensured the customer service agent it was an issue with the earbud never even turning on, but it seemed like the agent never even read my response, and listed a second list of actions I could take to reset the earbud. It was almost a direct copy of the first instructions, just more in depth, assuming I didn't understand the first email. I sent back a VIDEO, of me conducting those exact steps to reset, or charge the earbuds, proving that the earbud will not charge. 

For a 3rd time, they responded with a final list of instructions, again repeating the exact steps I have just performed on video. Clearly they did not read my last email, and even actually wrote the instructions in more depth as if I do not understand how to use electronics or read instructions. Also, these instructions were all on how to reset or properly charge the earbud, which I have no said over 3 times that it was not the issue. It also took multiple days for some responses and this part of my warranty was dragged on for over a week just to be exactly where I started. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, over 10 emails back and forth, they ""approved"" my warranty, and all I had to do was pay for tracked shipping and return it back to their warehouse. I asked if I could be reimbursed for this shipping, and was sent a snarky return stating how because they would be paying for the default shipping of the new pair back to me (default shipping is free for the customer on any earbud purchase keep in mind), and that they were doing me a favour by warrantying the earbuds FOR ME? I never broke the earbuds, I never used them, and they made it seem like a huge favour that they would be replacing them for me.  To avoid taking a &gt;$100 dollar loss now, I paid $20 for shipping and returned the pair back to them on September 20th. 

Now, the biggest insult out of this exchange, I only just finally received the earbuds today on November 9th.... over a month after shipping my pair back. I inquired about the process on my warranty on October 15th, and was sent a response that they have processed the warranty and they are just waiting on a tracking number from their dispatch team. I received my tracking information  over 2 weeks later on November 3rd. Not only did I pay $20 extra, than any other Mifo 05 plus customer, I received them 74 days after the date of purchase. I have not done any testing on if this earbud was worth the money, but nothing will be worth that 74 day wait, with the additional insult from the customer service experience. 

Throughout my conversation with them, I stated multiple times how displeased I was, even apologizing when I got frustrated with their copy and paste responses, and got nothing but scripted responses and no reimbursement besides the express shipping costs. I hope none of you ever had to deal with this warranty process and this has been my worst shopping experience ever.",terrible experience mifo audio canada preface literally never returned anything bough online even clothes bought fit stomached loss usually due high cost shipping back bit lazy first time returning warrantying anything horrible experience tldr order earbuds august express day shipping extra received broken earbuds day later dealt horrible insulting slow customer service finally accepted warranty september th pay extra ship back finally received ear bud day purchase november th b chose buy pair mifo plus mifoaudio ca mifoaudio ca research several pair decision made due high battery life case well customer service review order placed august th paid extra express day shipping since heading back country hike september st bought specific hike arrived september rd day purchase date upset requested refund express shipping finally approved several frustrating email back forth b end still left star review however left earbud never even turned instant took box left earbud never power never played single second music never charged course charged earbud case ensured earbud contact charging lead nothing happened couple hour charging instantly sent mifo email sent response step ensuring earbud properly charging clean contact lead reset earbud ensure bluetooth connection etc followed step ensured customer service agent issue earbud never even turning seemed agent never even read response listed second list action could take reset earbud almost direct copy first instruction depth assuming understand first email sent back video conducting exact step reset charge earbuds proving earbud charge rd time responded final list instruction repeating exact step performed video clearly read last email even actually wrote instruction depth understand electronics read instruction instruction reset properly charge earbud said time issue took multiple day response part warranty dragged week exactly started b finally email back forth approved warranty pay tracked shipping return back warehouse asked could reimbursed shipping sent snarky return stating paying default shipping pair back default shipping free customer earbud purchase keep mind favour warrantying earbuds never broke earbuds never used made seem huge favour replacing avoid taking dollar loss paid shipping returned pair back september th biggest insult exchange finally received earbuds today november th month shipping pair back inquired process warranty october th sent response processed warranty waiting tracking number dispatch team received tracking information week later november rd pay extra mifo plus customer received day date purchase done testing earbud worth money nothing worth day wait additional insult customer service experience throughout conversation stated multiple time displeased even apologizing got frustrated copy paste response got nothing scripted response reimbursement besides express shipping cost hope none ever deal warranty process worst shopping experience ever

There are soo many choices now then there were when I bought my Airpods 5 years ago. I think I've narrowed it down to few different pairs, the Beats Fit Pro or the Sony XM4's. I listen to a lot of podcasts around the house and while I'm out and about for the day. Things that are important to me are battery life, hands free voice activation, transparency mode to hear my wife, call quality, ability to play with just one earpod in at a time, and fit and comfort for long periods of time. Are there any others I should be considering?

Earbuds,"Earbuds I can sleep with Hello

Since I moved from the countryside to a big city I've had trouble getting quality sleep.

I think that has to do with traffic and overall noise of people in bars and in the streets since my appartment is up a narrow street and noice reverbates.

Earplugs are hit or miss, most of the time they just fall or don't fit properly. And having to change them regularly is a pain.

I have cheap earbuds already, Xiaomi's AirDots I bought for 15‚Ç¨ a little over a year ago and I'm very pleased with them. Surprisingly okay for the price.

But I think I want to upgrade to something better, and also to something that can help me sleep better if it exists.

What are your recommendations for this kind of use ?

I don't think I can go over 150‚Ç¨, but depending on the product I might go over.

Thanks ! :)",earbuds sleep hello since moved countryside big city trouble getting quality sleep think traffic overall noise people bar street since appartment narrow street noice reverbates earplug hit miss time fall fit properly change regularly pain cheap earbuds already xiaomi airdots bought little year ago pleased surprisingly okay price think want upgrade something something help sleep exists recommendation kind think go depending product might go thanks

Earbuds,"Best call quality earbuds 2021 I spent the last few hours on call with a friend trying to find her a pair of good call quality earbuds, and unintentionally ended up with a semi-comprehensive list. Keep in mind, though, this is based on my opinion and hers alone, and the website used for the audio was [rtings.com](https://rtings.com). Only no disturbance sounds tests were used as that was her use case. 

**Cost-effective - Tozo T6:** anything cheaper than this was just too poor to consider. These sounded audibly worse than the best below, but were also much better than a lot of more expensive buds.

**Flat out Best - Galaxy Buds 2:** of the about 50 to 75 earbuds we went through, the buds 2 were the fullest sounding, best overall call quality earbuds in a quiet environment.

General brand trends noticed: Apple and Bose didn't stand a chance. Both were substantially worse than the buds 2. Sony and JBL sounded hollow and were worse than the buds 2, but still better than the previous 2 brands. Lastly, Jabra was the closest second brand to Samsung, but the buds pro and buds 2 were just better with calls and overall quality.

Hopefully this helps! And keep an eye out for Black Friday sales for the buds 2, as they will certainly get much cheaper.",best call quality earbuds spent last hour call friend trying find pair call quality earbuds unintentionally ended semi comprehensive list keep mind though based opinion alone website used audio rtings rtings disturbance sound test used case cost effective tozo anything cheaper poor consider sounded audibly worse best much lot expensive bud flat best galaxy bud earbuds went bud fullest sounding best overall call quality earbuds quiet environment general brand trend noticed apple bose stand chance substantially worse bud sony jbl sounded hollow worse bud still previous brand lastly jabra closest second brand samsung bud pro bud call overall quality hopefully help keep eye black friday sale bud certainly much cheaper
