I bought a pair of Soundcore Liberty Air 2 refurbished on Amazon that arrived on Tuesday and since then my usage of the earbuds have been very limited due to the connectivity/pairing issues on the right earbud.

From the second time I use them after reseting and pairing them to my Galaxy S10, the right earbud just shuts down and reboots every 2 minutes. The only way I can fix this is to reset and pair them again until I put them in the box again and then I need to repeat this process. 

I've tried this multiple times and sometimes the reseting takes a bunch of times to actually reset properly.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

Is there a way to fix this or should I return them?

From crappy ones which cost only $5 from Taobao to amazing ones which cost around $50-60

still, there are thousands of budget &amp; affordable wireless earbuds out there right now, jammed pack with all kinds of features and I am sure many of you are having a tough time picking the right one for yourself.

So for my own lost, I am gonna talk about the three general types of users:

* Active lifestyle
* Average Joe, Average Jane
* Audio folks

**Average Joe, Average Jane**

These are the ""Everyday"" people. Usually they doesn't really ask for much but Just wants something which just works and works well.

Right off my mind, I would recommend the Baseus ENCOK WM01

It is Compact and sports a slick design

it is Easy to operate, fuss-free pairing &amp; re-connection, good battery life (5hrs @ 70% vol), decent audio quality

It uses USB-C charging

Even though it has no IPX rating, don’t worry about sweat if you hit the gym or go for a jog occasionally. It’s tested and proven by me \^.\^

&amp;#x200B;

**Active lifestyle**

If you are a gym-goer, the runner, the cyclist, the X-fitter, the Muay-thai, the F45-er, or basically exercise, working out is a big part of your lifestyle,

Then I would recommend either the MPOW MDots or the CKFN F18 ANC

These earbuds are literally waterproof, except for MDots as it is IPX6 rated while CKFN is IPX7 rated

This means that you can bring them for jetski, water-boarding, high intensity workouts etc, they will just continue to play your favourite tunes even if they are covered completely with sweat &amp; water

During my testing, these earbuds provide good seal which is important, especially if you workout in noisy gyms.

But if you really want to block out those noise, Then go for the CKFN F18 as they have Active noise cancellation features which will free your ears from those noises

Now, if you are someone who likes to do extreme sports, MDots include free earwings to ensure they are glued to your ears even when you are doing backflips or 720s.

Both also deliver decently loud volume output, decent audio quality and more importantly, BASS

&amp;#x200B;

**Audio Folks**

If you are concerned about experience, how your music sounds, the Bass, the soundstage etc, I would recommend the X-Mini Liberty+ Wireless Earbuds

Even though it uses 6mm Graphene-coated dynamic drivers. But these tiny guys are powerful.

They deliver good strong bass but not overpowering the treble.

When I listen to Pop and R&amp;B, these bring out the bass for a more satisfying listen.

Even when it comes to EDMs, these earbuds further accentuate them. Even though the sub-bass may not satisfy audiophiles but imo, it would definitely satisfy most bass lovers

Vocals are clear and doesn’t sound muddy

Sound stage is good. The instruments are spread out in a wide space. This tiny guys also support Qualcomm Aptx 

Finally, with a battery life of nearly 10 hours on a single charge and the case providing an additional 45 hours of playtime. You definitely don’t need to worry about that 8-hour playlist which your Airpods Pro will never be able to complete.

So honestly there are so many earbuds I have reviewed in 2021 and up till the making of this video, I have tested over 50 pairs. But this list is surprisingly easy to make as these are the fellows which left an impression on me throughout 2021. And they have always been at the top of my list. 

ButI hope this helped you to pick the right budget Wireless earbuds. Those are my choices. Let me know what are your own top wireless earbuds (under $50)

And yes, Airpods themselves are an obvious option. They're a good product. The problem is that I don't care for how Apple does business and especially how it handles tech support, so I prefer not to buy their products (let's not get into it, ok?).

The job I'm doing is an office job that requires a lot of moving, so the extra mobility of a wireless earbud is important. The problem is all wireless earbuds I can find have giant bulky things BEHIND the part that goes in your ear where all the technology bits are. I want something lightweight and streamlined so they don't hurt my ear.

https://preview.redd.it/keo5mjmg1la81.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07ef1267b0b9f35b73e64a806b1ba5c23ae1620

The shape of these wired earbuts is a perfect design. The plastic doesn't flare out past the silicone that fits in your ear and the hard bit that goes down to the wire is not sitting directly on the cartilage. Those two things together make sure it doesn't irritate the cartilage. I have yet to find a pair of wireless earbuds without either a giant flared base that sits directly on the cartilage OR a frustrating hard bit that sits directly on the cartilage. 

I'd prefer something like this with the traditional silicone seal bit (rather than the weird slide thing that the airpods have) because it fits better and is softer on the cartilage. I have sensitive ears and a bunch of hard plastic on the cartilage is a nightmare. 

Anyone have suggestions? 

I hate those neckbands too because I only wear them in one ear so I can listen to music at work but still be alert to what is happening around me and the needs of the office.

I am so glad that there is a community for earbuds here on Reddit. I sincerely hope y'all can help me out. I am looking for a pair of TWS earbuds but my use case seems to be very unique and there really don't seem to be a lot of products I've been able to find that would fit my needs. Here are the features I need:

* Independent function. I only wear one bud at a time so I'm not willing to use a pair with a master/slave relationship because then I am essentially paying for two and getting one bud.
* No mirroring. In addition to only wearing one at a time, I almost exclusively wear them in my right ear. This means that to be able to put them both to good use, they can't be mirrored. They need to be interchangeable.
* They must be LOUD! I use these mostly for biking and I listen to almost exclusively YouTube videos, podcasts, and audiobooks. this means that since I'm not really appreciating music or anything, they really don't need to be super great sound quality but I need them to be loud since I am typically listening very actively to my media.
* Price. I'm not going to be a huge stickler on this one but to avoid this having to be a thing I need every couple years when my previous one wears out, I was hoping to buy several pairs once I find a set that works for me. So I'm probably not going to be able to buy like 3 sets of $200 buds. That said, most of the higher-end ones don't have the independent function that I need so they mostly eliminate themselves.

Right now I am using the Kurdene brand S8 buds and would love to buy those again but much like my Losei buds from way back in the day, it seems that their newer ones are all lighter and SIGNIFICANTLY quieter.

Half of mine stopped working and I'm looking for a replacement

I just got the BeatsFlex since the X was discontinued and was disappointed to see that they're a lot more cheaply made, chunkier, and have this dumb smart feature that pauses your music for you when they hang down (and you have to wait for them to register that they're in your ear again to resume) *dumb* imo. And even sound worse than my X. I'm returning them.

Anything else out there that

\-Does not have a stupidly chunky neckband or control pads- is light and slim like BeatsX.

\-Has no 'sporty' wings to on the earbuds

\-Is not 'true' wireless i.e. Not seperate earbuds, I want them connected with a wire so I can just drop it around my neck and not worry about losing them

If you're on the fence between Spinfit CP100+/CP360/CP1025 for TWS buds, I'd wholly suggest the CP1025s for the checkout cart. The comfort is sublime compared to the other two variants and it'll fit most charging cases. 

Only exception is if you absolutely know that your TWS will hurt if it's placed deeper into the ear, then the CP100+ is the better option.

The CP360 IMO is really a fallback option if your ears will hurt with deep(er) buds placement **and** if your charging case will most likely not accommodate the CP100+.

**Detail:**
Spinfits are great aftermarket eartips but they aren't exactly cheap either. With many models to select from, it can be difficult to choose with a tighter budget. I have 3 variants on-hand, the CP360s, CP100+ &amp; CP1025 and after trying them all. I think I can safely suggest the CP1025 as the most versatile &amp; value-for-cash variant for all-round use.

**The Issue:**
Many TWS out there are absolutely fantastic for their prices to bring wireless sound for mobile use. But a persistent problem for myself has always been fit. 

I had long disliked in-ear closed-style buds due to the 'goldfish bowl' effect of having your ears plugged, but for effective ANC to occur, this style is pretty much mandatory now. The fit on these though have always caused me trouble with stock tips. Either they do not stay in-ears or they clog the ears up very uncomfortably for longer durations.


**Enter Spinfits:**
Recently, after much online recommendations, I've taken the plunge on Spinfits and I do not understand why manufacturers do not collaborate more often with them for silicone eartips. The comfort of these are way better than any stock tips I've used.

The issue however, is that there are multiple choices of Spinfits to choose from &amp; it's not easy to tell at a glance on their value proposition.

**CP360:**
This is the variant that usually gets recommended for TWS buds, but I actually find this as the weakest compromise. It's not  tall enough to achieve a seal easily and it's not soft enough to give comfort for deep placement

What results is a weird middle ground where the buds need to be inserted deeper for the secure seal which increases the stuffy and clogged feeling as more of your ear canal gets occupied. It's still more comfortable than stock tips, but leaves more to be desired.

**CP100+:**
These are more advertised towards wired IEMs rather than TWS as some charging cases simply won't accommodate their larger size.

However, the CP100+ gives me the best and easiest seal out of all 3 variants. It's tall height also means I don't have to insert the buds as deeply to achieve said seal and allows the tips to actually ""spin"" at a better angle to fit my ear canals, providing wat better comfort than the CP360s

The passive noise isolation is superb even while reducing the 'goldfish bowl' effect from such in-canal design.

If it were not for the fact that several charging cases cannot accommodate the CP100+, it'll be my personal recommendation for Spinfits for TWS.

I've not tried the original CP100 variant, but from what I gather, the Plus uses medical-grade silicone for best results against skin irritations.

**CP1025:**
These puppies are a real nice surprise. Given that I didn't enjoy the CP360s as much as the CP100+, I thought I would be let down by the even shorter height that would necessitate an even deeper earbud insertion for the seal.

However, the softness and flexibility of the silicone really overcame the discomfort of deeper placement &amp; it's by-far the most comfortable of all Spinfits I tried. It really alleviates *a lot* of the discomfort of in-ear buds, whether wired or wireless, in the first place.

The tradeoff is that cause the silicone is thinner for the softness, it doesn't provide as effective passive noise isolation than the CP100+, but the ability to wear &amp; enjoy the tunes in way better comfort outstrips any little loss of noise isolation. The comfort of these really cannot be overstated which really brings new life in my use of TWS earbuds.

**Conclusions:**
If I can only choose one variant without knowing how Spinfits are in the first-place, then the CP1025 would be the safest recommendation in terms of versatility &amp; compatibility (except for AirPods Pro &amp; Galaxy Buds Pro, which needs the adapter also sold by Spinfit).

If somehow you absolutely need the max passive noise isolation from Spinfit silicone tips then CP100+ are the next option; CP360 if you can foresee that the charging case won't accommodate the CP100+.

Nevertheless, all 3 variants are good in their own right and use cases and above all, way more comfortable than any stock tips due to their ""spin"" design.

Two days ago... I unboxed the REALME Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds...Charged it up and started testing it....  
After using it for a day... I realised two issues

* The ANC OFF/ON control
* A compromise to a modern-day wireless earbuds basic functionality

**1) The ANC OFF/ON control**

In order to Toggle ANC ON/OFF, you need to do it before you play any music or watch any video.If you are listening to music or watching a video, you need to pause first, and then Toggle ANC ON/OFF  
which to me, is kinda troublesome because I didn't have such issues with other ANC wireless earbuds around this price range.But if you are someone who don't Toggle ANC ON/OFF frequently, then this is not really an issue.

  
**2) A compromise to a modern-day wireless earbuds basic functionality**

And that is the Built-in Microphone.I was able to use the built-in mic to record audio with my iPhone.I was able to use the built-in mic to record WA audio.But I cannot use the built-in mic for a normal phone call, which to me is a major compromise on a modern-day wireless earbuds' basic functionality.  
But if you are someone who will remove your earbuds before you answer a call and talk directly into the Phone's built-in mic, then that is not an issue at all.

  
So I hope that those of you who are considering to get the REALME Buds Air 2 Neo ANC wireless earbuds.... do consider the two issues I highlighted above.

I’m looking for some earbuds and recently bought the Bose QC earbuds.  Problem is, the way they plug your ear, I can’t stand it.  I can hear myself walk, and breathe, and it’s just an awful feeling for me. I had to return them. 

I heard there’s a difference between closed vs open earbuds or vented vs nonvented but have struggled to find any specs online.  

I’ve recently been looking at the new Sony 1000XM4.  Maybe they are the same? I assume you have to fill the ear to get a good noise cancelling seal.  I’d rather compromise in noise cancelling than the plugging of the ear.

Some that I've tried that didn't work out due to fit:

I have very little experience in buying earbuds, so I'm hoping for advice from someone who actually knows what they're doing :-).  I'd love a specific recommendation, but I'll take advice for how to search on my own.

I'm looking to buy earbuds with a mic that works well for noisy environments.  I'm not very picky about how well I hear the call; what I care about is that my boss doesn't realize I went out for a walk.  Is there a specific technology that I should look for, that narrows this down?

I also need them to be wired, because Bluetooth tends to flake out on me at the worst moments.  But it seems to me that some earbuds have detachable cables.  Is this a gimmicky selling point, or does this stuff actually work well?  Because it would be nice to be able to take the cables off when I don't need the high level of reliability.

Side note: in this type of situation, like the Sure Aonic 215 Gen 2 ([https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/earphones/aonic215](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/earphones/aonic215)), where the hell is the microphone located?  Because the website makes it kinda look like there's a mic both in the earbuds themselves, and also on the cable.  How does this work in practice?

And, of course, then there's the budget.  I'd like to keep it under $150, but I don't know if that's doable with my requirements.  So I'm open to finding out I'm naive and need to spend more to get what I want.

TL;DR: how do I find earbuds that meet these criteria?

1. Mic works well in noisy environments. (Are there specific technologies that help with this?)

Há certas palavras que usamos de forma intercambiável, tais como efeito e efeito, ou eficaz e eficiente. E, claro, à primeira vista, eles soam e significam a mesma coisa. Mas o problema é que eles não o fazem. O mesmo se aplica aos fones de ouvido e [fones de ouvido](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultadores).  


Na verdade, são um grande exemplo de palavras que podem ser descritas como ""semelhantes, mas diferentes"". O que, nós acabamos de lhe dar um tiro na cabeça? Bem, o fato de você estar aqui indica que já teve algumas dúvidas.  


Não importa se você encontrou nosso guia tentando encontrar os melhores [earbuds](https://jolypops.com/collections/earbuds) baratos ou procurando por fornecedores de fones de ouvido populares. O que importa é que você quer saber como estes dois itens supostamente idênticos diferem. Você encontrará todas as respostas abaixo.

## Earbuds

O termo ""fones de ouvido"" é usado para descrever um pequeno dispositivo de plástico ou metal usado para ouvir música ou outras fontes de áudio. Os Earbuds também são conhecidos como monitores intra-auriculares e telefones de canal.  


Os Earbuds são bastante populares, especialmente entre os jovens e aqueles que usam seus dispositivos para exercício. Eles são confortáveis de usar e vêm em todos os tipos de cores e formas. Neste sentido, eles têm muito em comum com os fones de ouvido e os fones de ouvido, mas diferem significativamente.  


A principal diferença entre fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido é que os fones de ouvido são usados dentro da orelha. Os fones de ouvido, por outro lado, são usados por cima dos ouvidos. Uma notável exceção são os fones de ouvido intra-auriculares, que são basicamente protetores auriculares.  


Portanto, outra diferença importante entre os dois tipos de dispositivos é seu design. Os fones de ouvido são normalmente projetados para se adaptarem à forma do ouvido, enquanto que os fones de ouvido não são. É claro que há alguns brincos que são feitos para caber na orelha, mas não são muito comuns.  


Uma das coisas que tornam os earbuds tão populares é que eles podem ser com ou sem fio. Você pode encontrá-los com fios que conectam ambos os lados do dispositivo (isto é, esquerda e direita) ou sem nenhum fio.

## Auscultadores

os fones de ouvido são pequenos dispositivos usados para ouvir música ou outras fontes de áudio. Embora sejam freqüentemente usados de forma intercambiável com o termo ""auriculares"", e muitas pessoas pensam que significam a mesma coisa, isto não é exatamente verdade. Na verdade, há várias diferenças entre os dois termos:  


Primeiro, os fones de ouvido são usados por cima do ouvido, enquanto os fones de ouvido são usados dentro do ouvido. Portanto, o projeto dos dois é diferente.  


Você pode encontrar diferentes tipos de fones de ouvido, tanto com e sem fio. Você pode encontrar monitores intra-auriculares projetados para uso esportivo e modelos mais elegantes projetados para uso diário. Há até mesmo alguns fones de ouvido que vêm com tecnologia de cancelamento de ruído incorporada para que você possa desfrutar da música sem ser incomodado por ruídos externos. Eles tendem a ser um pouco mais caros do que as versões normais, mas valem a pena se você quiser ouvir música sem distrações do mundo exterior.  


Há também uma diferença significativa no preço quando se trata de fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido. Os fones de ouvido tendem a ser mais caros do que os fones de ouvido porque há mais tecnologia envolvida para fazê-los funcionar corretamente, especialmente aqueles que são sem fio.  


Isto não significa que os modelos sem fio são automaticamente melhores; significa apenas que você terá que pagar mais por eles. Entretanto, se o custo não for um problema para você, os modelos sem fio podem ser uma opção melhor porque lhe dão mais liberdade de movimento e você não precisa se preocupar em arrancar acidentalmente seus fones de ouvido durante seu treino ou atividades de trabalho.  


Fones de ouvido vs. fones de ouvido: Qual devo escolher?  
Os fones de ouvido com fio são geralmente mais acessíveis do que os fones de ouvido, mas podem ser menos confortáveis de usar por longos períodos de tempo. Os fones de ouvido tendem a ter melhor qualidade de som do que os fones de ouvido, mas podem não ser tão portáteis ou confortáveis às vezes.

## Vantagens de Earbuds

Os protetores auriculares são compactos e fáceis de transportar.  
São baratos, o que significa que são fáceis de substituir se perdidos ou quebrados  
Você ainda pode ouvir o que está acontecendo ao seu redor quando você está usando o auricular  
Eles não ocupam muito espaço em sua bolsa

## Contras de los earbuds

Os Earbuds podem ser desconfortáveis.  
Eles são fáceis de perder ou quebrar  
A qualidade do som não é tão boa quanto os fones de ouvido intra-auriculares.  
Às vezes é difícil encontrar um par que se encaixe de forma segura e confortável.  
É mais provável que você tenha uma infecção de ouvido com fones de ouvido do que com fones de ouvido.

## Vantagens dos fones de ouvido

Com fones de ouvido, você pode ouvir música com mais clareza porque eles cobrem todo o ouvido.  
É menos provável que os fones de ouvido caiam de seus ouvidos.  
Algumas pessoas descobrem que são capazes de se ouvir quando usam fones de ouvido, porque há menos ruído de fundo do mundo exterior.

## Contras do fone de ouvido

Talvez você não consiga ouvir o que está ao seu redor se os usar.  
As orelhas podem doer após longos períodos de uso.  
Os fones de ouvido são mais caros do que os fones de ouvido, portanto, se quebrarem ou se perderem, custarão mais dinheiro.

## Em resumo

Em resumo, a principal diferença entre estes dois tipos de fones de ouvido é que os fones de ouvido ficam dentro das orelhas, enquanto os fones de ouvido repousam na parte externa das orelhas. A preferência pessoal e o orçamento entrarão em jogo ao decidir qual tipo se adapta às suas necessidades.",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7506,public,self,Qual é a diferença entre fones de ouvido e fones de ouvido?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/rqahq8/qual_é_a_diferença_entre_fones_de_ouvido_e_fones/,all_ads,6,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'vORzRR1Iv3Wh3yGKhPg4NKWvV2Irv5xS5EjGvVfB4qE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 132, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0cdbd2482d7b85d9b4bf50461eb451d534d80ca', 'width': 108}, {'height': 264, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c21768a2457187248ef56fb63b2d75a589275519', 'width': 216}, {'height': 391, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5891ba98198bda4f2d45d648f9e436e17e85e5be', 'width': 320}, {'height': 783, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf3ed8e198b5955539e75484b58fc0415de5faef', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1175, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa50652953aec50b2e2f355fdeef507aacf13f3e', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1322, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a90b7ae3c6df56e99a8a874fa5a11ac637824d8', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1469, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YlQXErbq3Aj5XDxoK05jW1BbaDQSKfUoYDSmC7RBlnw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=272961c786471c6540b34efb05af1859cefd8298', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",123.0,140.0,,,,,"{'04bn0iz3p8881': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '04bn0iz3p8881', 'm': 'image/jpg', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/04bn0iz3p8881.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c8096a81972411572b0ac4605124bc73a6c7af9', 'x': 108, 'y': 95}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/04bn0iz3p8881.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=928c180d667dce41477bab8b13c19e0e8db1e1e2', 'x': 216, 'y': 190}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/04bn0iz3p8881.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf18fe73602b981eceb7287eae6bea930f0f440b', 'x': 320, 'y': 282}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/04bn0iz3p8881.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c86cb8c2110e9d8635068bf5d32b6cc9beed03', 'x': 640, 'y': 564}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/04bn0iz3p8881.jpg?width=690&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9994812db705b1a32c386967601f6c30f4613f6a', 'x': 690, 'y': 609}, 'status': 'valid'}}",,,,,,,,,,

I shared a new video on my personal thoughts about the QCY HT03 ANC wireless earbuds after using it for just 24 hours.  


Regular pairing with devices through the Bluetooth menu was fast and easy.  
But to sync it with the QCY app... crazy!  


The location of the touch control area, a flat surface on the stem (like AirPods Pro) is facing inwards. Therefore, my index finger had to ""dig"" in slightly in order to get to the flat surface.   


The usability of the ANC feature is weird as well. To toggle ANC on/off, I will need to stop the music/video first and then Toggle ANC on/off. if I try to toggle it while listening to music/video, it doesn't work.  
This is completely different from the ANC wireless earbuds I have tested.

A little back story. I have owned the original Galaxy Buds since day 1, however, they received the washer treatment and died. But any time I used them, my ears would itch. So I recently bought the Buds 2. They sounded ok, but felt too light and almost like they would fall out, but ears itched. Exchanged those for the Galaxy Buds Pro. I really enjoy the sound and the 3D audio is pretty cool. But after 30 minutes of use, my ears started to hurt and today, I have an ear infection which if you read, there are some people with the same issues.

Fast forward and thinking about returning the Buds Pro and getting the Liberty 3 Pros. So my questions are:

1) How is the sound vs the two? Is the bass there? How is the music and can you really hear if you know what I mean?

2) How is the 3D audio sound on the Liberty 3 Pros when listening to music and movies on like Netflix, etc...?

So, I have a normal right ear and a deformed left ear. This deformity leaves a very narrow canal (in addition to minor cosmetic issues).

My right ear may be normal, but the canal is definitely on the small side. 

I have bad luck with earbuds. The AirPods Pro are the only ones I have some success with. I can get the bud into my right ear with the medium tip as long as I angle it in (the stem is not straight down—it’s more towards the back of the ear). 

I had lots of trouble with the left ear. Large worked as long as I didn’t try to push it in but it hurt and wouldn’t stay. 

I tried Bose QC noise-canceling buds and I could not get them into either ear, even with the small. 

I care about noise cancellation. I’m thinking of trying the Sony WF-1000XM4 but it sure doesn’t look like those things will work out. Does anyone have suggestions?

Then I visited this subreddit and someone pointed out that when he mentioned this on gamesky's comment section, the comments were deleted.


Today I go to look and see the gamesky listed this pair as the number one pair under $100?

Literally a rebranded enacfire a9  that license the palm  and charges $70 extra as the best pair under a hundred bucks?  That's hard to believe on its own, but even if it's true, he has an obligation to explain to the audience that these are the exact same body as the a9.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that his deal with  whatever company is licensing the name palm  has included in a contract. Something of him not mentioning that.

I can't guarantee that but otherwise why would he deprive his audience of that information when you can buy the exact same pair for a third of the price on Amazon today??  If there is a difference in sound quality, explain it! 

I'm sorry but at this point gamesky is  a salesman more than a reviewer.  I know most of these influencers will say that these companies don't have final say over their reviews and that is true. But if you read these deliverable partnership agreements, they have less freedom than they like to admit to say what they believe.

Obviously bose is amazing and better quality but heard it sticks out of your ear and if you unplug the left one your music stop or something like that. As with the Buds Plus, everything is very good but average, as in go exercising, decent volume and whatnot. I understand that both have their ups and downs but what to see what people recommend. And three side notes, I have a Samsung S20 Plus which why I said about having adapters. Main music I listen is more to metal but I do tend to listen other genres here and there. And lastly with price, doesn't matter to me cause I got these deals at my best buy and I can put in a bit on the bose since it's 30 or 40 dollars more than the ones I got or save up store credit and go for the Buds since they're cheap as of now",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7393,public,self,Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus vs Bose QuietComfort Earbuds;,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/rmbnwl/samsung_galaxy_buds_plus_vs_bose_quietcomfort/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purchased these buds a week ago after doing a lot of research. Thought this short review might be useful.

1. Fit: They fit well and don't fall when walking. However, they are not secure enough for running or doing other activities as will fall. Also, they kinda hurt my ear cannals. Not sure if its because my ear cannals have a strange shape, or its me trying to push them as far as possible. Still trying to get used to them.

2. Mic quality for phone calls: phenomenal, so far. I am talking a lot during the day and used them for hours in different apps (whatsapp, viber, normal phone calls) and conditions (shopping centre, busy street, supermarket, indoors) and the other party were always telling me my voice is very clear and the background noise is minimal. They have a feature called Just My Voice which is on by default. It is only activated automatically when on a phone call or recording voice via sound recorder. It basically acts like a gate, blocking all noise that is below the set threshold and leaving speakers voice on. Works really well! Note that if you try to record a video or send a voice message via whatsapp, viber, etc, the Just My Voice feature won't work and there will be a background noise - it will only work during phone calls.

3. ANC: Its my first ANC earbuds so I can't compare with the others BUT it does work really well and blocks most of the noise considerably. I am happy with the results.

4. Sound quality: mids and highs are really, really good, but the lows are muddy and bass sounds like it is a little distorted. Playing with EQ doesn't help, it seems its a part of the sound signature or limitation of the 8mm driver. I would say they are not very good for bass heavy tracks. But mids and highs are very clear.

For the past month I am trying to arrive at a purchasing decision for tws earbuds best suited to OnePlus 7t

Requirements are
Loudness,Anc if possible,bass response preferred,wish to use the codecs aptx and Ldac,no stems if possible.

Previous and current usage of earbuds
Bullets 2 
Sony wi c310
Pixel buds series A buds-most comfortable but low volume
Sony xb 700 -the bass just drowns everything.

Preferences
Galaxy buds 2
Galaxy buds pro -they look bulky and painfull
OnePlus buds pro-initially thought to purchase however it just looks like it looses more with codecs then gain a lhdc(codec) which ain't compatible with my current phone.


Overall supper confused.

Dont want to invest in 
Sennheiser momentum 2 as they are damn expensive.
Jabras as there are reports to hissing sound continuously.
Sony as they way to costly.

The Reflect Flow's hurt my ears or didn't fit good (tried all eartips and earwings) and the 230's were actually a good pick for me. The fit was great and they were quite comfortable! The sound was good, battery life, everything was good for the price. But since a few days the right earbud doesn't shut off randomly when I put both I the case. I tried everything: reconnecting them to my phone, checking if they didn't connect with the charging points, factory reset the buds, deleting the JBL app without succes... So, I'm thinking about returning these too. Then the JBL Live Pro+ seemed interesting to me. They seem similar to the 230's, but a bit better in everything. Although I have one concern. The eartips the Live Pro's come with look pretty shallow, comparing them to the tips that came with the 230's. And since the fit of the 230's was almost perfect, I question if these will fit as good as the 230's. My right earcanal is very slightly tighter than my right ear, but I was able the use the medium tips on the 230's just fine! So would the Live Pro's be something to consider? Also, I want to use the buds for multiple activities: mostly traveling/studying, not often a phone call, and for working out (jogging, lifting weights).

I'm hearing mixed reviews on KZs and Moonbeam Quarks which used to be somewhat of a standard for cheap wired IEMs. The main complaint I see with the Quarks is cable noise, and I move around a lot at my workstation which has swayed me away from them. I'm also wondering if there's some type of bluetooth dongle that would allow me to use the T6s I already have with these other devices at a similar pricepoint; mainly my laptop and TV. I should also mention that I have narrow ear canals; which were part of why I opted for the T6s. I could honestly go smaller as they are a little too snug even with the smallest tips they came with.  


I appreciate your time and suggestions in advance; it's reassuring to get advice from people that have likely used a lot of different products.

Below are my thoughts/concerns atm, please give advice.

(Background - I use earbuds for workouts, I don't really care about app support based on my experience with Soundcore Life A2 NC, and I care about sound quality, call quality and ANC)


1) 1More Comfobuds Pro

Positive:
- strong ANC
- good sound quality

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)


2) Earfun Air Pro 2

Positive:
- Wind noise reduction when in ambient mode, or so I heard (impt - cos I use ambient mode when I run)
- Good sound quality
- Good ANC

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)


3) Earfun Free Pro 2

Positive:
- good sound quality
- secure fit (ear hooks)

Concerns:
- not too sure about ANC/ambient (since the original Earfun Free Pro had rlly weak ANC/ambient, heard the new model is okay only)
- battery life a bit on the short side


4) Anker Life P3

Positive:
- highly-praised app(not that important for me personally)
- good sound quality
- good anc?

Concerns:
- Secure fit? (I use my earbuds for workouts)
- audio dropout issues ( experienced this with me Anker Life A2 NC, a bit scarred lol)

Do you know any Earbuds with **Semi/Open-Fit In Ear** (*Not Over the Ear, but like Airpods 3*) fitting, so I CAN HEAR the conversation around me at the office, instead of MUFFLING it – so I’m not looking into much of ANC – and  I’d also like Multipoint/Automatically Switch between paired devices, like listening music thru PC, and I can hear Notification or Calls coming in my cell to pick up or check.

Other criteria is:

* Capable of Mono Mode – can use independently is a MUST.
* Preferably, Wireless Charging with USB-C changing
* Above Average Battery Life would be nice
* Decent Microphone for calls

I recently got Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro… as they tick MOST of the criteria I'm looking for, I really wanted to LIKE them, but they plug my ears too much, in order to HEAR the surrounding sound, I have to PULL THEM OUT… 

With Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, even with single use. it seals up too much (even using a smallest ear tip), even when I select “Transparency Mode”, I have to pull out in order to have a conversation with others… ☹

I hope there is something out there!!!

I'm trying to find ""fun"" sounding TWS buds, preferably with warm sound. I just got TWS1 Pro and tbh I really don't like those, the trebles can get very harsh and it hurts my ears and while bass is quite realistic, I find it a bit lacking. I don't really like EQing too much, when the base experience isn't fun to begin with.

I like treble a bit more than bass, but I like warmer earbuds since bright ones sometimes make the sound a bit fatiguing to listen to and overall warm sound is just way more pleasant for me. I have M50X headphones and I really like them, while they are a bit muddy, I like their quite warm sound.

I listen to hip-hop, metal, trap etc.

As an alternative, I think of getting Soundpeats Sonic or maybe H1, or maybe even Huawei FreeBuds 4i if I really don't find anything good.

So I got the P2 but I'm not convinced I'm gonna keep them, so looking for replacement suggestions.

Things I liked:
- TWS
- Price
- IPX7

Things I disliked:
- Poor bass
- Fall off kinda easily while walking/commuting. Need to readjust them often

Any suggestions that tick the dislikes?

I'm currently using the stock size M eartips. It fits well but after a while my ears starts to hurt due to the fitting. I tried the size S, too small. I tried the size L, won't fit.

So i was using FIIL T1XS and nothing more serious before that. unfortunately i lost the charging case and after days of watching videos i found a good deal on ""blue"" version of CBP and got it. (you may ask why color matters? i'll answer that in a sec). i try to compare these to fiils.

**1. Build Quality**   
 its fine .. nothing premium nor cheap. i love the colors and the fact that it has a matt finish. also case is very pocketable but very slippery so be careful. on the other hand T1XS is glossy and case ""was"" not as pocketable and was making quiet a bulge.

CBP : 8.5/10

T1XS: 8/10

**2. Fit and Comfort**

its somehow subjective but CBP fits ""my ears"" wonderfully and is ""very"" comfortable. i've never had a buds this much comfortable that i could listed to music for hours without earache. these don't go as deep and wont make a suction feeling in the ear.  Also I feel eartips are pretty high quality. I have a sensitive skin and  fortunately these dont make any allergic reaction. 

T1XS on the other hand fit very good but unfortunately too much tight and make you feel a suction in your ears (at least with default eartips) also eartips aren't that high quality and make itching after a while and i feel pain after 2-3 hrs.

CBP 10/10

T1XS 7/10

**3. Sound Quality**

(there will be a but.. continue reading to the end)

First time i put these in my ears i was shocked (in a bad way) because based on reviews i expected something balanced and neutral. out of the box these are noticeably warmer than T1XS and low frequencies are more emphasized here. I mainly listen to metal and pop. electronic guitars sound pretty muffled here. bass is satisfying but not as tight and overall sound is not as clear as i'd liked. some minor details sound too warm and not clear enough. also soundstage is somehow intimate. on the plus side, vocals and instruments sound lovely and warm. you can hear instruments well seperated. and it never sounds harsh (trebles are controlled). also volume is reeeeealy high.

I have dolby atmos eq in my phone but no matter how much i played with frequencies i couldnt make them clear enough. But... i said in the begining there'll be a but..! if you go in the app and select ""POP 1"" EQ, it gets MUCH better. electronic guitars now have the liveliness that i like and i even like them more that T1XS because i feel they have more texture and warmth to them which i really like. also i boosted trebles in dolby atmos eq and now they sound much better. and i love the sound now.

T1XS on the other hand sound very clean and sharp (metal EQ in the app is my favorite). it can get a little harsh but you can eq them. also i really love the bass on these (more than on CBP) .. its very tight and kicks hard. i dont like loose bass (some may do). on the other hand after using CBP i feel vocals on T1XS are somehow thin dont have the warmth and body that CBP has.  

overal score after EQing them:

Bass:

CBP: 8.5/10

T1XS: 9/10

Mids:

CBP: 9.5/10

T1XS: 8/10

Treble:

CBP: 9/10

T1XS: 9/10

Sound stage:

CBP: 6.5/10

T1XS: 7.5/10

Details:

CBP: 8/10

T1XS: 8.5/10

**4. Call Quality**

no competition here. CBP is superb and T1XS is simply bad. no matter the environment, you can have an easy call on CBP

CBP: 9.5/10

T1XS: 4/10

**5. Features**

ANC and Transparency on CBP are good. ANC reduces low frequencies very good. but mids and highs comes through. Transparency sounds pretty good and you can have conversation easily.

CBP:  
ANC: 8/10 transparency: 9/10

T1XS: Transparency: 4/10

on the other hand CBP lacks gaming mode and i wish it had it.. because i like to connect my buds to tv (monitor) these work fine but if you look for it you can see there's some delay (about 50 ms) but gaming on mobile feels bad.. theres +300ms delay. 

**6. verdict**

I wouldn't like these if i'd got the black or white color. fortunately new EQ made the sound very pleasing for me. i only wish it had so much better sound stage and details where a tad cleaner.

these are very versatile. good sound, very good ANC and call quality, and good price. i got the blue color the same price as others but does it worth more ? i'd say yes for me.. i'm happy that i picked these .. cant imagine living with default of these EQ.",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7251,public,self,My review of blue colored 1more Comfobuds pro,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/re3hds/my_review_of_blue_colored_1more_comfobuds_pro/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I went around and tried out all the earphones I'd been considering, plus the Sennheiser Momentum 2 since the shop guy recommended it. They were really patient so I was able to listen to multiple songs and make WhatsApp calls to my wife to test out the sound as well as the mics. The mic test was done in the middle of the mall, in a very noisy environment with people talking, music playing etc. 


Sony WF-1000XM4: Great sound quality, great noise cancellation. Mic clarity was really good, but the mics let in noise when I was speaking. But they felt a bit heavy / large in my ears. 

Technics EAH-AZ60: These had the best sound quality of all the buds I tried, even better than the Sony's. The ANC was definitely worse than Sony WF-1000XM4. The mic didn't let any noise in, but voice clarity wasn't great. This was a bit surprising since I'd heard great things about their mics. Overall the worst mic amongst the buds I tried (not bad by any means). Fit was really good, they felt light and small.

Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro: You're right, they don't carry the Air 3 Pro. Sound quality was not very good. There was a lot of bass, but it was poor quality base, quite bloated. ANC was significantly worse than Technics EAH-AZ60. Mic quality was great, with good voice clarity as well as background noise suppression. The best mic amongst the buds I tried. Fit was good, not as nice feeling as the Technics, but better than the Sony's.

Sennheiser Momentum 2: This wasn't in my list of considerations, but the guy encouraged me to try these and said the sound quality on these is supposed to be quite good (and I'd heard them reviewed so). Unfortunately, I found the sound to be quite mediocre, possibly worse than the Soundcores. Since I didn't like the sound, I didn't bother to test the mic. I liked the fit, the second best after the Technics.

Overall, I think I will pick the Sony WF-1000XM4, since it is the best balance of Sound, Mic, ANC for me. I hope the long term comfort on these works out.",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7249,public,self,Sony vs Technics vs Soundcore vs Sennheiser,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/rdzmuz/sony_vs_technics_vs_soundcore_vs_sennheiser/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've gotten in the habit of buying a whole lot of cheap earbuds and being dissatisfied for one reason or other, and would love some advice! Look for the following, preferably at under $80 - as I'm also in the habit of very easily losing earbuds...

* Devices: I primarily switch between my iPhone and apple watch for audio, ideally would like to use these on my PC as well. Not expecting multipoint at this price, but would like to not have a painful switch process 
* Uses: primarily podcasts, music, and phone calls! 


* bonus: comes in colors aside from black? Purely aesthetic but I'm just not a fan of black earbuds!

Hello,  
I  want to buy earbuds preferably around $50 to Max $100 CAD. I know I  wont get a great sounding ones but just it would be great it they have  good bass and does OK job for phone calls.  Could you please suggest me  some?

I also head that most of the  wireless earbuds suffer in making calls, even the expensive ones. In  that case would opt for wired earphones.  I am been considering these:

I have a pair of airpods 2 that works well with my Macbook for calls and meetings working from home. The issue is that the battery doesn't last all day long and I have to have an alternative while it' charging.  

I've tried in ear (sits in the ear canal) and I feels like my voice comes from inside my head which is annoying and after sometime my ears canals are really sore.

I am shopping for new earbuds this Christmas and I would really want to upgrade to some higher quality ones for a better music experience.

My price range is around 100-cca200 (if it's like 220 that's also ok but really don't wanna go much higher). 

I am mainly looking for something that's more towards mids and highs with a normal bass. When looking for earbuds I always had the problem of getting ones that amplify bass which then proceeds to overshadow vocals and essentially downgrade most of the songs for me (Right now I have JBL T210 and it's exactly that case). 

I usually listen to stuff ranging from AC/DC through indie, alternative, classical, rock instrumental to avici and more party songs but almost never to drums n bass, techno, electro etc. At the same time it would be great if the headphones can actually highlight the different instruments in the song without overshadowing vocals (The JBL T210 I have now does an okay job of highlighting different instruments and sounds in a song but really overshadows vocals at the same time).

I was looking into etymotic but I am also not a fan of the extreme sounds isolation where I can hear my heartbeat and every scratch of the cable at the same time. I would rather prefer the standard style of buds that can be found on the cheaper headphones where the sound isolation isn't extreme so I can still somewhat register what's happening around me.

I know its a lot of things but I have been searching for a while and really struggle to find something that would fit this, so if you have any advice on a pair that could satisfy these requirements that would be super cool.",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7208,public,self,Do you know of some nice earbuds that could satisfy these requirements?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/rbsie6/do_you_know_of_some_nice_earbuds_that_could/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is that she is so... clumsy. She's around 60yo, and I'm a little bit concerned about the fact of being completely isolated about the sounds surrounding her may led her to some troubles. But every model I see these days is sold under the fact of ""being completely noise cancelling"" or similar, when I'm looking for exactly the opposite.   


So any model of any brand would work for me in this situation unless for these two things;   
\- not preventing her of listening important things like I don't know, the doorbell ringing, voices around her or even a car's horn.  
\- being relatively easy to connect and to use for an old person  


Are you aware of some models that check on this needs? Am I being too paranoid and buying her any model and asking her to NEVER use it at max volume would work fine? Are any of you in a similar situation?

I have 2 Soundpeats TWS earbuds that have this problem ONLY on windows.

Bluetooth dongle has the Realtek RTL8671b chip inside and its BT 5.0, this problem also was present with a BT 4.0 card, here the overview:

Windows 10 :  
NON-Game mode: 0 Problems, sounds amazing, has 150ms delay  
Game mode: the ""slave"" ear bud ( the second to leave the charging case ) starts crackling 10 seconds after game mode is activated and never stops, delay is virtually non existent compared to wired in ears.

Ubuntu:  
NON-Game mode: 0 Problems, sounds amazing, has 150ms delay  
Game-mode: 0 Problems, sounds amazing, has virtually non existent delay compared to wired in ears.

What I tried:  
\- Different bluetooth adapters

\-Formating windows partition and reinstalling

\-giving the bluetooth Server higher cpu priority on windows

\-manually updating the drivers of the BT Chip to the latest released by Realtek

\-changing USB ports

\-using an extenssion and have the USB dongle on my shoulder to rule out intreferences

Keep in mind that this is not a poor connection case or anything as it works just how you would expect it to do so on Ubuntu !

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I don't sleep with them in, I have them in the charger when I'm not using them, and I never drop them either. I take great care of them and can't think of why they keep doing this. I recently got gifted a pair of power beats pro and they are already starting to show signs of breaking(In my experience anyway), disconnecting randomly(though not too often), and they occasionally don't disconnect or connect to my phone when I put them in or out of the charger.

The earbuds in question are Sennheiser cx 150 bt, and the Jabra elite active 75t.

Being that previously I only used cheap ( sub 20$ ) wired earbuds, I don't really know what is to be expected from the bluetooth ones, but given that both are from reputable brands I would at least expect for the volume to be balanced properly.

The problem is as the title describes that on both of these one side gradually loses volume until it is barely audible.

On Sennheisers I first started noticing this problem in about six months of using them and on Jabras I noticed it on my second week of use. I don't think the problem is with my ears, as when I swap the sides the same earbud is still muffled

The strange thing about it is that the problem ""fixes itself"" after I  charge them. I have noticed that sound gets muffled more often when the battery is low ( around 30% ), but it doesn't explain why is it only on one side. I guess I could understand with the Jabras as each earbud has its own battery, but the Sennheisers seem to share the same battery.

app and fit. Download the app, update the earbuds\' firmware, and maybe consider buying the Spin Fit 360 ear tips if the stock tips cause too much fatigue. PULL THE TRIGGER AND BUY THESE!\n\n(I started writing and couldn\'t stop raving)\n\nFor months, I was struggling to decide what to buy. I was looking for a pair of gym-ready earbuds with quality sound, a good mic for work, and ideally noise cancellation and multipoint connectivity(also for work). I watched hours, if not days of YouTube reviews and scoured internet blogs, which I will reference at the end. As far as I could tell based on what criteria I had, my top options were the Jabra Elite 75t or 85t, which are still limited to right bud Mono. The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, which have reports of causing ear infections and aren\'t a great fit for fitness activities. The Jaybird Vista 2\'s, which have a reportedly low mic and wind-noise reduction performance. The Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 (LP3), which are godsend for some and wildly overhyped for other.  Or i could go big and get the Sony WF1000-XM4, which have reports of ear fatigue because of the beefy size, not to mention the $$$... Decisions...decisions...\n\nAdmittedly, I waited for the BF deals to help make my decision, so I ended up buying these from Verizon for $129 with low to moderate expectations per the reports of them being overhyped. Since most people probably use Reddit and Amazon, I figured I would give back to the community there... I\'m no reviewer nor have I ever written an in-depth product review, but here\'s a Mechanical Engineer\'s take on the LP3s after 1 week of frequent and varied use (gym, work, com-calls, home, outdoor runs).\n\nMy Audio history: way back (pre 2014) I rocked some  SkullCandy wired earbuds(\\~$20). Then, I used both gens of the Soundcore Slims (\\~$20-$40) back when they sold in a variety of colors, then they switched to the current design from what I can tell. The Jaybird X....(1\'s?) were somewhere in the mix of things (JBX). I\'ve used the stock buds with iPhone and Pixel 3. My first and preceding pair of true wireless buds (TWS), were the Creative Outlier Airs (COA) (\\~$60), which went through the washer and dryer....TWICE... (Impressively they worked after the first cycle).. I\'ve also owned Audio-Technica M50s (\\~$80) (2016) and Sony WHXM2s (\\~$350 retail but purchased on eBay for $130) over-ear headphones.Lastly, I borrowed my friend\'s WFXM4s ($280) and another\'s AirPod pros for an hour each. I\'m not an audiophile, but I\'ve sampled a range of price points and design styles. Personally, I\'m not a fan of the way ear pods fit, as I have quite small ears. They tend to fall out, although the AirPod pros fit much better than the wired ones I once knew.\n\nDisclaimer, I have tried the LP3s with Spotify Premium, YouTube, SoundCloud Go+, and Netflix on a Windows 10 Laptop, iPhone 8, and a Pixel 3XL. That means I have not had the chance to truly test the LP3s LDAC  feature, as none of these devices have that capability. I don\'t think any Apple products support LDAC, but from what I heard, these do a pretty good job if you have a device and streaming service that support LDAC\'s highest transfer rate (990 kbps).\n\nApp: 5/5 - I\'m putting this up top as I find it\'s MOST IMPORTANT. I tested a few features before and after updating the earbuds firmware, and hats off to Soundcore for making drastic improvements! IMO, the ANC and passthrough got the biggest bump, so if those are your complaints, try this. It seemed to be a night and day difference in feature performance and sound stage. The most important feature to take advantage of is the HearID and ANC Ear Canal test. The former results in an optimized EQ per earbud, so if your right ear and left ear are sensitive to different frequencies, it will provide an EQ for both. I learned that one of my ears cannot hear one of the high-frequency tones that the other can after doing this. Impressive and alarming. The Ear Canal Test has to be run in a noisy environment to optimize the ANC. I recommend running both of these tests after each time you change the ear wing and ear tip sizes, as that will impact the fit and seal in your ear. I\'m not sure that it makes a difference, but it makes sense to me that it would. I find my HearID resulted in a signature that was ear piercing in the highs, but you are able to tweak it. Although, It did help me hear some cymbals in a song I\'ve listened to for years and had no idea they were there. You can customize the touch gestures for whatever input you want (play/pause, next track, volume control, ANC/Transparency toggle, etc.) aside from mic muting.  Additional features the app is needed for include Multipoint Connectivity, Fit Test, Wear Detection, and Wind-Noise Reduction.\n\nSound Quality: 4/5 - I\'m sure other buds sound ""better"", but these sound phenomenal for the price! I am picky when it comes to the sound stage for each genre I listen to, and these delivered with the app\'s assistance! I look for a full, rich, sound when I listen to Holiday Jazz, Piano, and Big Band music. Well, there\'s an EQ for that.... emphasize that bass kick and guitar for Classic Rock, Metalcore, alt. Rock... There\'s an EQ for that...For my favorite genres (according to that Spotify 2021 recap) of House, Dance Pop, Pop Rap, and Vapor Twitch, I like that Boomy Bass and energetic soundstage... You guessed it, there\'s an EQ for that! If the EQ isn\'t up to your standards you can also manually adjust the EQ settings for the 100 dB, 200 dB, 400 dB, 800 dB, 1.6k dB, 3.2k dB, 6.4k dB, and 12.8 kHz frequencies. The Soundcore EQs help immensely and help you hear things you didn\'t know were in the song. Originally, I was disappointed with the sub-bass, but the Spin Fit 360 earbud tips helped improve that. I was surprised at how well an ear tip change impacted the sound quality. The 3D sound feature disables LDAC, and is situationally average. I can provide an experience as if you are listening to the music from surround sound speakers instead of earbuds, but occasionally it makes those speakers sound cheap. I am not sure what they were going for, but it seems to just open up the sound stage. Personally, I usually opt for the alternative EQ options, unless the 3D experience is fitting. It\'s not worthless, but should be improved! As I mentioned above, during all of my research on buds, I learned the app and host device also play a big role in the sound quality. Spotify sounds substantially quieter and flatter even with the EQs, compared to SoundCloud, which isn\'t even top of the pack as I understand it. Tidal, Deezer, Amazon Music Hifi (or whatever they\'re calling) all seem to be something to try if you\'re interested in a high-quality, lossless audio experience. You might also want to grab some wired earbuds as well if that\'s your top priority. All in all, I am very impressed with the sound quality of these buds.\n\nFit: 4/5 - They give several options for ear tip and ear wing sizes. It\'s easy to play around with. Don\'t be afraid to use different sizes for each ear. After optimizing the fit, they feel very secure for activities such as cardio and weight lifting. However, it\'s definitely a game of finding your balance between snugness and ear fatigue. These protrude out of your ear a decent amount, so sleeping on your side with these probably won\'t be an option. Don\'t be concerned about the size, though, the wind noise reduction does the trick for my fellow runners. Compared to my brief time with the WFXM4\'s these feel less fatiguing, but they are certainly heavier than the AirPod Pros. Jaybird wingtip\'s hook design language is a better and more comfortable implementation of ""wings"", but these still do the trick of keeping the buds secure.\n\nMic: 4/5 - I have done a couple of recordings in both a quiet and noisy environment and the results were solid. I\'ve also asked a few people while on the phone, and they said I sound great. I do not have anything to compare this against, but I am happy with what I\'ve heard. If this is your biggest concern, I would consider the AirPods Pro or Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro depending on what phone you own. The beauty of the Jabra and Soundcore options is that the performance is more or less independent of the device you are using it with. However, there are reports of the mics working better with non-Apple products.\n\nNoise Cancellation: 4/5 - the 5 star rating is reserved for over-ear headphones and the Sonys and Boses of the world. However, these still do an excellent job! The app lets you toggle between Passive, Normal, and ANC. Within the ANC option you can also choose what level you\'d like. The Normal option on it\'s own does a good job of attenuating noise, and the ANC takes all those hums and buzzes away. Higher frequency noises (chatter, squeaky toys if you have dogs, etc.) will still leak through, but it\'s more of you\'re aware the noise is there rather than actually being able to listen to it. It\'s non-obstructive. Once you turn on Music + ANC, all of the surrounding noise dissipates. If you plan on listening to podcasts, reviews, or media with inconsistent volume, you may have to turn these up a little to help with a noisy background environment. Overall, these do a great job. They\'re worse than my over-ear XM2s, but were a fraction of the price and size.\n\nTransparency Mode/Pass-Through: 4/5 (after firmware update) - it\'s hard to imagine transparency getting much better. This mode amplifies the sounds from your surroundings so you can hear them without removing your buds. It doesn\'t have the auto-pause feature when you speak as some other buds do. Occasionally, you may have to remove an earbud (which triggers auto-pause if you leave Wear Detection enabled) to understand people better. Generally, I\'m fine leaving them in and having conversations. Since Transparency is good enough to have conversations you can also assume they\'re good enough for running and gym settings as well. Can confirm.\n\nCase: 4/5 - This case is, in my opinion, better than the XM4s, which feels plasticy with a cheap hinge. This lightweight case doesn\'t necessarily feel premium, but it has already survived a few drops onto hardwood and concrete. The sliding mechanism is springy. Lastly, the wireless charging seems to have a magnet which snaps into place on my standing Anker PHONE charger, which was a pleasant surprise. My only complaint is that occasionally the buds don\'t snap into place when you toss them in the case. You CAN shut the case without the buds being in their charging position. Make sure that the charging indicator light inside the case is on for both earbuds.\n\nOVERALL: 4/5 - Like i said earlier, I\'m trying to be a good critic. I\'m sure there are better buds out there, but these are competing with buds that are $40-$100 more expensive. These have a real 15/16 Leicester FC energy to them!\n\nImpactful Resources for my decision:\nhttps://www.soundguys.com/headphones/true-wireless/\n\nhttps://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-guide-20026/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/4xk5sx/what\\_are\\_mids\\_highs\\_lows\\_etc/\n\nhttps://versus.com/en/wireless-earbud\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZ4ivUawsXRktLKej8d6Xw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/CEONTHEMAKING\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/PickyAudio\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKnV3AVMyRhb00s8si1QTQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/FlossyCarterGoogleGangsta\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChi\\_LhxT2sYcrV0SB2wCQug\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFHXvPvKR0eezgZLYhzlhg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7QwWqU\\_ZcWVko-SZvgcdMg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2MOjih52hqzk9YljFvdhw', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;edit: Lengthy Liberty Pro 3* review and some grammar... whoops😅&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: The bad reviews on this product likely were from people who didn&amp;#39;t optimize the app and fit.

They tend to fall out, although the AirPod pros fit much better than the wired ones I once knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer, I have tried the LP3s with Spotify Premium, YouTube, SoundCloud Go+, and Netflix on a Windows 10 Laptop, iPhone 8, and a Pixel 3XL. That means I have not had the chance to truly test the LP3s LDAC  feature, as none of these devices have that capability. I don&amp;#39;t think any Apple products support LDAC, but from what I heard, these do a pretty good job if you have a device and streaming service that support LDAC&amp;#39;s highest transfer rate (990 kbps).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;App: 5/5 - I&amp;#39;m putting this up top as I find it&amp;#39;s MOST IMPORTANT. I tested a few features before and after updating the earbuds firmware, and hats off to Soundcore for making drastic improvements! IMO, the ANC and passthrough got the biggest bump, so if those are your complaints, try this. It seemed to be a night and day difference in feature performance and sound stage. The most important feature to take advantage of is the HearID and ANC Ear Canal test. The former results in an optimized EQ per earbud, so if your right ear and left ear are sensitive to different frequencies, it will provide an EQ for both. I learned that one of my ears cannot hear one of the high-frequency tones that the other can after doing this. Impressive and alarming. The Ear Canal Test has to be run in a noisy environment to optimize the ANC. I recommend running both of these tests after each time you change the ear wing and ear tip sizes, as that will impact the fit and seal in your ear. I&amp;#39;m not sure that it makes a difference, but it makes sense to me that it would. I find my HearID resulted in a signature that was ear piercing in the highs, but you are able to tweak it. Although, It did help me hear some cymbals in a song I&amp;#39;ve listened to for years and had no idea they were there. You can customize the touch gestures for whatever input you want (play/pause, next track, volume control, ANC/Transparency toggle, etc.) aside from mic muting.  Additional features the app is needed for include Multipoint Connectivity, Fit Test, Wear Detection, and Wind-Noise Reduction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound Quality: 4/5 - I&amp;#39;m sure other buds sound &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;, but these sound phenomenal for the price! I am picky when it comes to the sound stage for each genre I listen to, and these delivered with the app&amp;#39;s assistance! I look for a full, rich, sound when I listen to Holiday Jazz, Piano, and Big Band music. Well, there&amp;#39;s an EQ for that.... emphasize that bass kick and guitar for Classic Rock, Metalcore, alt. Rock... There&amp;#39;s an EQ for that...For my favorite genres (according to that Spotify 2021 recap) of House, Dance Pop, Pop Rap, and Vapor Twitch, I like that Boomy Bass and energetic soundstage... You guessed it, there&amp;#39;s an EQ for that! If the EQ isn&amp;#39;t up to your standards you can also manually adjust the EQ settings for the 100 dB, 200 dB, 400 dB, 800 dB, 1.6k dB, 3.2k dB, 6.4k dB, and 12.8 kHz frequencies. The Soundcore EQs help immensely and help you hear things you didn&amp;#39;t know were in the song. Originally, I was disappointed with the sub-bass, but the Spin Fit 360 earbud tips helped improve that. I was surprised at how well an ear tip change impacted the sound quality. The 3D sound feature disables LDAC, and is situationally average. I can provide an experience as if you are listening to the music from surround sound speakers instead of earbuds, but occasionally it makes those speakers sound cheap. I am not sure what they were going for, but it seems to just open up the sound stage. Personally, I usually opt for the alternative EQ options, unless the 3D experience is fitting. It&amp;#39;s not worthless, but should be improved! As I mentioned above, during all of my research on buds, I learned the app and host device also play a big role in the sound quality. Spotify sounds substantially quieter and flatter even with the EQs, compared to SoundCloud, which isn&amp;#39;t even top of the pack as I understand it. Tidal, Deezer, Amazon Music Hifi (or whatever they&amp;#39;re calling) all seem to be something to try if you&amp;#39;re interested in a high-quality, lossless audio experience. You might also want to grab some wired earbuds as well if that&amp;#39;s your top priority. All in all, I am very impressed with the sound quality of these buds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fit: 4/5 - They give several options for ear tip and ear wing sizes. It&amp;#39;s easy to play around with. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to use different sizes for each ear. After optimizing the fit, they feel very secure for activities such as cardio and weight lifting. However, it&amp;#39;s definitely a game of finding your balance between snugness and ear fatigue. These protrude out of your ear a decent amount, so sleeping on your side with these probably won&amp;#39;t be an option. Don&amp;#39;t be concerned about the size, though, the wind noise reduction does the trick for my fellow runners. Compared to my brief time with the WFXM4&amp;#39;s these feel less fatiguing, but they are certainly heavier than the AirPod Pros. Jaybird wingtip&amp;#39;s hook design language is a better and more comfortable implementation of &amp;quot;wings&amp;quot;, but these still do the trick of keeping the buds secure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mic: 4/5 - I have done a couple of recordings in both a quiet and noisy environment and the results were solid. I&amp;#39;ve also asked a few people while on the phone, and they said I sound great. I do not have anything to compare this against, but I am happy with what I&amp;#39;ve heard. If this is your biggest concern, I would consider the AirPods Pro or Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro depending on what phone you own. The beauty of the Jabra and Soundcore options is that the performance is more or less independent of the device you are using it with. However, there are reports of the mics working better with non-Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noise Cancellation: 4/5 - the 5 star rating is reserved for over-ear headphones and the Sonys and Boses of the world. However, these still do an excellent job! The app lets you toggle between Passive, Normal, and ANC. Within the ANC option you can also choose what level you&amp;#39;d like. The Normal option on it&amp;#39;s own does a good job of attenuating noise, and the ANC takes all those hums and buzzes away. Higher frequency noises (chatter, squeaky toys if you have dogs, etc.) will still leak through, but it&amp;#39;s more of you&amp;#39;re aware the noise is there rather than actually being able to listen to it. It&amp;#39;s non-obstructive. Once you turn on Music + ANC, all of the surrounding noise dissipates. If you plan on listening to podcasts, reviews, or media with inconsistent volume, you may have to turn these up a little to help with a noisy background environment. Overall, these do a great job. They&amp;#39;re worse than my over-ear XM2s, but were a fraction of the price and size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transparency Mode/Pass-Through: 4/5 (after firmware update) - it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine transparency getting much better. This mode amplifies the sounds from your surroundings so you can hear them without removing your buds. It doesn&amp;#39;t have the auto-pause feature when you speak as some other buds do. Occasionally, you may have to remove an earbud (which triggers auto-pause if you leave Wear Detection enabled) to understand people better. Generally, I&amp;#39;m fine leaving them in and having conversations. Since Transparency is good enough to have conversations you can also assume they&amp;#39;re good enough for running and gym settings as well. Can confirm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case: 4/5 - This case is, in my opinion, better than the XM4s, which feels plasticy with a cheap hinge. This lightweight case doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily feel premium, but it has already survived a few drops onto hardwood and concrete. The sliding mechanism is springy. Lastly, the wireless charging seems to have a magnet which snaps into place on my standing Anker PHONE charger, which was a pleasant surprise. My only complaint is that occasionally the buds don&amp;#39;t snap into place when you toss them in the case. You CAN shut the case without the buds being in their charging position. Make sure that the charging indicator light inside the case is on for both earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OVERALL: 4/5 - Like i said earlier, I&amp;#39;m trying to be a good critic. I&amp;#39;m sure there are better buds out there, but these are competing with buds that are $40-$100 more expensive. These have a real 15/16 Leicester FC energy to them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impactful Resources for my decision:\n&lt;a href=""https://www.soundguys.com/headphones/true-wireless/""&gt;https://www.soundguys.com/headphones/true-wireless/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-guide-20026/""&gt;https://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-guide-20026/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/4xk5sx/what%5C_are%5C_mids%5C_highs%5C_lows%5C_etc/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/4xk5sx/what\\_are\\_mids\\_highs\\_lows\\_etc/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://versus.com/en/wireless-earbud""&gt;https://versus.com/en/wireless-earbud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZ4ivUawsXRktLKej8d6Xw""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZ4ivUawsXRktLKej8d6Xw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/CEONTHEMAKING""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/CEONTHEMAKING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/PickyAudio""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/PickyAudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKnV3AVMyRhb00s8si1QTQ""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKnV3AVMyRhb00s8si1QTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/FlossyCarterGoogleGangsta""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/FlossyCarterGoogleGangsta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChi%5C_LhxT2sYcrV0SB2wCQug""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChi\\_LhxT2sYcrV0SB2wCQug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFHXvPvKR0eezgZLYhzlhg""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFHXvPvKR0eezgZLYhzlhg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7QwWqU%5C_ZcWVko-SZvgcdMg""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7QwWqU\\_ZcWVko-SZvgcdMg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2MOjih52hqzk9YljFvdhw""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2MOjih52hqzk9YljFvdhw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'headphones', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rcyx', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/headphones', 'subreddit_subscribers': 740698, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Lengthy Liberty 3 Pro Review', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 11, 'upvote_ratio': 0.88, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/r86hkg/lengthy_liberty_3_pro_review/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",,,,,,,,

I was coming from using a Master &amp; Dynamics MW07go set for reference. The sound quality is great, but that is about all they have going for them. Mics are awful and only the right one can be used independently.

The only earbuds I found that met the requirements were the Technics and the Liberty Pro 3s and maybe the Elite 7 Pros (if the update ever happened). Obviously the LP3 reviews were all great and it seemed like a great option, but I wasn't sold on the form factor or case size. Kept searching long and hard for reviews of the AZ60's and finally found 2 reviews of the Technics that had mic samples and was impressed enough I bought them from Amazon.

The Good

I've been using them daily for about 10 days now including a week of work and I love them. I have quite a few WebEx/Teams/Zoom meetings during the day and listen to audio from my phone a good part of the time I'm not in a meeting. This is why I wanted something with good mics and multipoint. I was switching between my earbuds and a dedicated BT headset (Plantronics Voyager 5200). As I've used them for calls, I've not had a single person complain or say I wasn't clear. I tested them vs the headset with a coworker on a call and they said both were good quality. You can also test the ""Just My Voice"" background separation in the app by listening to yourself with a delay. I turned some music up loud and then talked and the playback didn't include any noticeable background noise.

Sound quality is great and that is without LDAC enabled (enabling it eliminates multipoint). I do have the app set towards a high quality connection vs more stable connection but not using LDAC the majority of the time.

The earbuds are extremely comfortable and fit well in my ears. They don't feel like they are going to fall out and I don't feel like i have to keep adjusting them, they just stay put.

Multipoint works well and pauses the audio on my phone when I join a call on my laptop. 

The Bad

The capacitive touch for the ""buttons"" are  extremely sensitive and I find myself occasionally double tapping one when just trying to hit it once. I do prefer the physical buttons on the MW07 but its not a deal breaker on these and really is only a slight annoyance on occasion.

The Rest

Battery life seems to be as advertised. Single earbud use works as advertised. The case is small enough to carry around in a pocket and not notice it. As for ANC, it works but this is my first set with it so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I will keep the MW07go's around for yardwork or things that involve getting sweaty as they have a much better IP rating but these are certainly my new daily drivers.

- ANC
- no stem designs
- comfortable
- good for working out / running
- able to use either bud independently
- similar to Earfun battery life or better
- will last a few years
- under $100 preferably, $120 is my max

Hi Budders, I’ve been reading hard for the past 5 days of subscription and need some help.

Situation:

* Seeking a reasonably priced pair of wireless earbuds
* Main usage while riding a motorbike with a full-face helmet
* Want small and comfortable earbuds to fit inside the helmet comfortably (also to get the helmet on and off without dislodging)
* Voice control while riding (pause, skip, volume up/down) and I use Apple iPhone, so possibly Siri compatibility
* Battery life is not a major
* Want a rechargeable case
* Noise cancelling is not a major, but I would like the ability to turn NC off

From my reading, I like the reviews on (good sound, small form):

* Earfun Free 2 ($80 AUD)
* Anker Life Dot 2 NC ($180 AUD)

I can’t work out if these earbuds have Siri capacity. Any help would be appreciated, thanks grove heads.",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7110,public,self,Earfun Free 2 or Anker Life Dot 2 with Helmet use and voice command,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/r7j423/earfun_free_2_or_anker_life_dot_2_with_helmet_use/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm talking, like, 16 hours.

I work a really boring job and listen to music and podcasts all day so I just don't think I can stand around with nothing to entertain me for a whole day while I have these awesome things in my ears, even if they seem to work great.

The alternative might be to wear over the ear headphones with them, but the reason I wear earbuds is because I'm so sensitive to pressure that I have never in my life found a pair of headphones that didn't over time feel like a vice on my skull, so I won't be likely to take that suggestion.

ANC was the most important factor for me in deciding my new earbuds and the Bose QC did not disappoint. The noise cancellation is amazing! I have a clicky g915 keyboard and I can't even hear the keys when I'm typing at my desk. 

But man it's really disappointing how buggy they are. The first time I paired them, I've had siri prompt at least 30 times without exaggeration. It was every few seconds. On top of that, my music or calls will keep randomly ending. I've tried fiddling around with options, updating the app, connecting through the app, bluetooth, both, etc and it got better. I found that connecting via bluetooth (not through the app) and turning off automatic ear detection really helped.

I will be returning these because siri still prompts out of nowhere in a quiet room. I was just on a zoom call and in the middle of my presentation it completely hung up the call. I had to log in to my computer and use my wired headphones to finish where I left off.

It's really unfortunate because these are so nice, but man. Has anybody else had these issues.

TLDR;

Bose prompts siri every few seconds and does a bunch of random functions. Fixed it temporarily with settings, but siri prompted and then hung up my zoom call mid-presentation so I had to use wired headphones.

I started looking for a pair of good but not expensive earphones recently, and I came across these two. I can´t decide which one is better.

I am almost determined for Soundcore because of all the positive reviews, but idk. I´m just concern that the sound quality and ANC isn´t as that good as everybody say so. But on the other hand, their app seems very nice.

With huawei I´m afraid that they won´t fit that well in my ears, that they would fall out or smth. Also theirs app isn´t that good as soundcore´s is.

I got them on sale from Amazon after reading all the good reviews on here and elsewhere. I had been using a pair of SoundPEATS Truengine SE until they stopped working. I wanted something much smaller to replace them, and with the offer of ANC and ambient mode, the Free Pro seemed like a good option. But after a week i'm not sure i'll be keeping them.

The case is tiny, much smaller than i had expected, and fits easily into a pocket. The buds themselves are also probably the smallest i've seen at this (or any?) price point, and are very light. They fit well, and with the wingtips i feel no movement when out and about. I've not owned headphones with ANC or ambient modes before so can't compare, but the options are nice to have. Although i generally find i get enough passive noise cancellation with buds, so after testing them out it's not as big a deal for me as i had thought. The bass is loud / prominent (whether this is good or bad might be subjective... see below), and i generally don't have a massive problem with how they sound. Battery life is also good. 

However i'm finding the buds to be very fiddly to get out of the case, especially with the wingtips in... there's just not a lot to grab. There have also been a few times the buds have maintained a connection with my phone, despite the case being closed. I think this is due to them not being flush when put back in, so i really need to push them down to make sure they're secure. And while the buds are initial very comfy, i've experienced some ear fatigue after about 45 minutes to an hour. I'm experiencing the odd drop out too, lasting a second. It's not terrible, but last night i had about 4 drops in 30 minutes. 

Perhaps the most frustrating thing (before i get to sound quality) is the touch features. The right bud has a 2 second press for voice assistant. It seems very sensitive, and despite me having Siri and voice assistant turned off on my iPhone, pressing it still triggers the function. I have already accidentally called my landlord from 3 years ago, as well as a couple of distant family members i have no interest in talking to at midnight, despite me not knowingly saying anything particularly audible. Am i dumb or is there really no way to disable this?

Finally there's the sound. I know this is going to be subjective, especially because i can only compare them to the sound on my previous buds. I should also say i'm definitely not an audiophile. But i often find the bass to be quite muddy and even boomy, bleeding into other instruments rather than complementing them. Mids feel kind of 'loose'. I do listen to quite varied music, and find this experience worse with some styles / genres than others. I've subsequently picked up a pair of Anker's Liberty Air 2 and the sound comparison is pretty wild ( although i don't think the Liberty Air 2's sound that great either tbh).

Has anyone else experienced these issues? Am i just being unreasonably picky?

Also, can anyone recommend a similarly small pair of earbuds, preferably without stems, which maybe even have an app to adjust the EQ (and none of the issues above!)?

I've been trying to find some solid comparisons and I know these are different classes so to speak. XM3s are the top of line a couple years ago, Studio Buds are basically airpods with some ANC.  But right now, the price difference is fairly negligible, about $30 between the two (XM3 = $129, Studio Buds = $99).  Would love to hear opinions.

My priorities are, in order: fit &amp; comfort, use-case, sound and mic quality, and then case/battery

How comfortable are the Beats vs XM3s?  How well do they stay in?  I don't do much jogging/running, mostly walking. 

As for use-case...

I'm on iOS, which is the main reason the Beats Studio Buds are being considered. But other needs are gym use, work, and travel (via air). 

Work I wouldn't be on too many calls and I can be in a quiet area (I currently take calls using old apple wired headphones). 

Gym, I mainly do weights and calisthenics, very little cardio (my cardio comes from group classes where I couldn't even use earbuds anyways). 

Travel, mostly airports and airplanes. I'd like to drown out a ton of noise in the planes and most in the airport, but I'd like to still be able to hear when needed for alerts.

Sony's always been pretty solid for sound quality (I'm not an audiophile but I can def tell shitty sounds vs good sound) and, never owning Beats before, I've heard it's a lot more bass-heavy, which I don't care too much about. Noise cancellation, it's not a huge deal to me and I actually don't mind some noise (especially if I'm in an airport so I can be cognizant of any airline/gate updates)

The case/battery issues for me aren't as big of a deal since both have enough to last an airport trip and I wouldn't put the case in a pocket, more than likely I'd be having them on my carry-on or, if I'm going to the office, would be in a laptop bag. 

I'm leaning towards the Beats Studio Buds, but would like any opinions on why they would go for the XM3s vs the Beats Studio Buds.",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,7055,public,self,WF-1000XM3 or Beats Studio Buds?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/r4r5cy/wf1000xm3_or_beats_studio_buds/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She's having trouble hearing certain voice tones now. She got examined by a nurse and was told that she would likely need hearing aids in the next two to three years if it continues to worsen at its current rate. Both of her parents had hearing aids as well in their later years, though idk if they had tinnitus.

My bf has tinnitus as well, but he literally constantly has an airpod in one ear playing music or videos to drown it out, even sleeping with it in. I was thinking of getting my mom some earbuds or headphones so she could listen to stuff while she works to drown it out, but she really doesn't like the feeling of earbuds or anything touching her ears, and headphones are even worse, so I'm kind of at a loss. I'm also worried about how she'll deal with a hearing aid in a few years as a result, but we'll see to that when it's time.

Does anyone have any recommendations for some incredibly comfortable earbuds? Like, ones that are very light maybe, so you can barely feel are there? 

If it helps to put a sob story as well for traction, my mom is genuinely one of the most hardworking, kindest people I've ever met. It's really not an exaggeration. She works 65 hours a week atm but that's the *least* amount of hours she's ever worked in her life - when I was in high school, it was around 90. She does an hour of exercise every single day - she used to do an hour and a half. She donates so much blood that every few years they tell her she can't anymore because she needs more iron, so then she eats a bunch of steak and takes iron supplements for a while and then goes back to it. She does charity work every single year. I've never heard her cuss or seen her drunk once. Point is, she's an extremely rare person, and it's not fair that she's done everything right and now her ears are fucking her up :(

I have only ever been using wired headphones and earphones until this spring. After upgrading from my 5+ years old Galaxy S7 to a modern phone, going TWS instead of dongles seemed like the smarter choice. Read some reviews and discussions, watched some videos, then finally settled on the CX 400 BTs from Sennheiser. Experiencing the simplicity of TWS for the first time was super uplifting and these earbuds way overdelivered on my expectations regarding sound quality. My plan was to use these for daily wear, commute, lounging etc, and get something cheap(ish) but IP certified for workouts. Even though these aren't very expensive or hard to find, and I'm just lifting weights and doing some cardio in the gym, I started to really appreciate these earbuds and didn't want to ruin them if they truly can't take a little sweat. Cheap but IP certified turned out to be Sony WF-SP800 when a very trustworthy retailer had them on sale for 60€. Pricing error or not, they delivered my order and I was anxious to try them out. Long story short, they aren't for me. Using the Sennheisers 2-3 hours a day then popping these into your ears, the difference in sound quality (and signature) won't go unnoticed. That was my smaller problem though, because what ruined the whole experience for me was the terrible fit. No matter how I combined the tips and wings, they just refused to sit in the right place, and because of this I can't really talk about their ANC (heartrough and smart pause worked well though). New plan was to keep using this suboptimal setup until Sennheiser comes out with something that combines their fit and sound quality with the features the CX 400 is missing to be an all purpose pair (for me anyway) and doesn't cost 250-300€. Well, more than half a year later here we are. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows, but after using the CX Plus for 2 weeks I'm very satisfied.

**What's better?**

* *Sound quality* is even better now. The 400s are a very balanced pair, but have a bit of a dreamy undertone that overshadows some details. The CX Plus makes the mids and highs crisper, that delivers a noticeable difference, especially in podcasts and audiobooks.
* Before using it, had no idea how useful and comfortable *transparent hearing* can be on your all purpose earbuds. With the 400s I had a choice between putting them back in their case like a good boy every time I had a small conversation, paid for my coffe etc, or clumsily shove one/both in a pocket. This makes things so much simpler and it's well executed as well (no weird tones, noises or directions).
* *Establishing the connection* after taking them out of their case is much faster. There's also mono mode which I don't think I'll ever use.
* Water (splash) resistance at *IPX4.* Nothing fancy, but one shouldn't be afraid to use these for regular workouts or in the rain.

**What's the same?**

* I still love how these *fit* in my ears. After a 4 hour train ride I wanted them out, but I think that goes for every deep silicone tip style design (at least the ones I've tried, wired or not).
* Charging and *battery life* didn't change based on my experience. Haven't done a 100 to 0 test with the CX Plus, but the 400s usually lasted about 6 hours on a full charge at 70-80% volume on the few occasions I commuted all day. Usually charge the case once a week.
* Making phone calls in windy or noisy (road) environments will still result in a lot of complaints thanks to their subpar *microphones.* They get the job done, but can be frustrating to both parties.

**What's worse or just plain bad?**

* Considering the perfect fit and passive isolation they provide (in my ears at least) this *ANC* is a joke. Ok that's a little harsh. This will definitely help you with quieting down the sound of keyboards in the office, or the constant humming of trains and commute in general. But this will do almost nothing when you try to lock out the gym's shitty music or want some peace and quiet in a cafe (chatter and cutlery). I don't have much experience with ANC, maybe this really is what people would call mid tier or good enough (based on the reviews I saw) but in my eyes this is barely more than a gimmick.
* Back in april I chose the CX 400 instead of the Galaxy Buds Pro because sound quality is the most important thing for me, and was ready to give up on some features I had no experience with (back then), including *wireless charging.* I'm not saying it's something super important to me, I don't even have a charging mat even though my S7 supported it back in 2016. But there were a few times when I forgot to charge the case and would have loved to use reverse wireless charging to top it off a little bit.
* Button is gone from the case that lit up the *battery level indicator.* Minor gripe, but I was hoping they would go the other way, and let us check battery status more precisely.

This is it basically. They're a really good, more sound than features focused all around headphones, and if you can get them for a good price (got mine for 100€) they will deliver on the value perspective as well. If not for the transparent mode, I'd say just go get the regular CX True Wireless, because it's a fair bit cheaper at retail and shares all the important aspects of the Plus model. 

Seems like Sennheiser woke up and realized there are some basic requirements and features people expect to be met at certain price points. Let's hope they will continue to refine them, because there are still a lot of things to improve.

The declining battery life, therefore, is proving to be a real problem so I'm looking for the *right* second pair to switch to when they run out of juice. 

The Bose SoundSport Free are far from ideal but certain features they have are indispensible for the way that I use them -- I mostly listen to podcasts all day while I'm working, I often stream the news on my laptop, then movies and TV on the flat screen (hooked up to a Mac Mini) at night after my early bird husband goes to sleep. I switch between devices frequently.

Here's my feature wish list:

* Physical buttons or button-like controls -- no touch controls!
* Volume control, forward/reverse, call answer/end on earbuds
* Pairs to at least 4 devices 
* Ability to switch quickly between paired devices using an earbud -- no fiddling with disconnecting one device, then connecting to another device via settings or app!
* Low latency -- I'm not looking for perfection but it can't be so obvious as to be distracting
* Plays well with Macs and other Apple devices
* Rich sound / strong bass, fairly broad soundstage -- if they can be EQ'd to get the right sound, great, but a fancy app isn't necessary
* 5+ hours of continuous listening time
* Find my earbuds feature

So far I've tried and sent back:

* Sennheiser CX -- horribly uncomfortable for me, could never get the sound quite right (too quiet, too thin and treble-heavy), hate the touch controls, app was a bit messy, audio lag, extremely poor customer service, no quick switch between paired devices
* Beats Fit Pro -- no sound customization via app, USB-C to USB-C cable only, no quick switch between paired devices, must use Siri or app for volume control! Stupidly expensive for how little you get.
* Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro -- phenomenal sound and PNC, comfortable, app is great, audio lag, call sound quality very poor (left bud kept crackling and cutting out), hate touch controls
* Jabra Elite 7 Active -- decent sound with EQ in app, not super comfortable, app freezes/crashes alot/poorly designed, earbud design makes it hard to know when they're in correctly so the mic was sometimes pointed in the wrong direction and muffled my voice, case is very difficult to open and buds have to be turned around and flipped over to get them seated.

Despite their many flaws, at this point I'm close to just buying another pair of my old Bose clunkers, but I'd prefer to get something that's a bit more technologically and aesthetically up to date...

That's what tws earbuds should embody. The P2 mini nail the comfort, but they lack the convenience by lacking volume control. Too many times I go to reach for one of my earbuds to raise or lower the volume - only to forget I can't on this pair. It frustrates me.

-

THAT said... despite this extremely obvious and avoidable deficiency, I can't help but reach for these time and time again. Mainly because they're comfortable, and they sound good. They're comfortable because they're compact and light, and they sound good because Soundcore knows what they're doing - except leaving volume controls off this earbud. 

-

Seriously, if these HAD volume control, I'd say forget anything else under $100 unless you NEED the more tech forward features and just buy these. It still boggles my mind that companies leave out one of the most basic functions of owning an earbud, but I guess product testing has deemed otherwise (I cannot fathom another reason for leaving out volume control). 

Beyond that, these are a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds, and I hope the trend of making smaller, more ergonomic designs vs packing in every feature possible becomes more viable. 

These are $20 at Best Buy in the US, and $30 on Amazon through Cyber Monday. YMMV if volume control kills it for you, but they sound good, they're comfortable, the charging case is actually good quality, and they're just fun to use.

I am looking to buy a new premium pair that has the longest Battery life from a single charge with ANC enabled for working out only

money is no object, case size and additional case recharges are a bonus but not really a factor 

I listen at 40-50% volume with a maximum of 70% during really heavy attempts for hype 

Here's my list
1. Sony's WF-1000XM4 - 250$
2. Master and Dynamic MW07 PLUS - 200$
3. Jabra Elite 7 pro - 200$

Now here's where things get interesting, it's a bit of a long explanation so sorry. 

according to each company's website

the Sonys last for 8 hours with ANC (12 without).
The MW07 Plus lasts for 10 hours, and the Jabra 8 hours (no ANC rating)

Easy then, just get the XM4s right?

Well, I used reviews from 2 websites that I think are the best in earbud reviews from a thorough investigation point of view to see the quality of the ANC and battery life. 

Sound guys (they test battery life at 75 dB output volume) and Rtings (90 dB output) 

Let's get ANC quality out of the way first. 
According to sound guys, the only site that tested those 3 earbuds 
XM4 &gt; MW07 Plus &gt; Jabra (however Jabra has awesome isolation due to deep in ear fit) 

Unfortunately, the only common review between the 2 sites is the Sony XM4.

RTings should have the lower battery life since they test at a higher level. But they got ~11 hours with ANC on. Whereas Sound Guys got 7H45M as per Sony's claims..Which when compared to their reviews of the MW07 Plus (9 hours with ANC on) and Jabra Elite 7 pro (8H45M) makes me inclined to get the MW07 Plus instead of the Sony.. 

When checking both websites' galaxy buds plus reviews as a reference point for earbuds that I know how long they will last from actual usage. I saw the same thing. RTINGS lasted longer (13H30M hours vs 11H45M)

However, other reviews show expected results where RTings has the lower battery life, like the Anker Life Q35 over ear headphones 

I'm more inclined to believe the Sound Guys reviews more. However I think that their Sony review has something wrong with battery life testing, Perhaps a feature that wasn't turned off like the always on ambient awareness that recognizes if someone is talking to you and turns on ambient mode, or 3D audio, or they used the LDAC Codec 

I'm looking for feedback from you guys, what do you think I should get?

As for the rebel earbuds. I'm not a audio geek so for me the audio quality is really good! Especially with the Bass Boost EQ for a nice party in your ears. The other EQ is house of Marley preset. This one gives you less bass but more of the others. 

Touch controls are nice, previous, next, volume up and down and change EQ. One BIG thing that is missing is the play/pause option. The touch controls can't be changed as there is no app to do this. 

Lastly about the build of the buds. The case is big but holds a lot of charge. The buds themselves can go for hours. (When writing this i wore them 5 hours and no sign of low battery). Don't be mistaken the earbuds are big, the first time i saw them is was shocked. They were a little painful at first but i got used to them.

My Fiil T1 pro, Sabbat X12 ultra, and soundpeats trueair2 always fall off when I'm jumping especially when I'm already sweaty. Hence, I think Over Ear earhooks tws is the way to go.

My soundpeats truewings is faulty now after over a year of use. Any recommendations?

1) When I'm using them I can select ""Headset (The Gaming Earbuds Hands Free AG-Audio)"" or I can select Headphones (The Gaming Earbuds Stereo)"". When I have the Headphones option selected I get no sound from whatever game I'm playing, nor can I use as a mic, but I can turn volume up, change sound profile etc by tapping on the earbud itself. When I use the Headset AG-Audio option I get sound from my game and can talk with my friends but I'm no longer able to control volume by tapping the earbud or change the sound profile. Which seems dumb because these boast having the Hypersync Low Latency feature but I can't even turn it on for a game......

The problem I find is all the reviews and opinions out there. Some swear by the QCY T5 or something similarly priced (&lt;35,-). Others say 150,- is the sweet spot. Others say 250,- and still not that great. Often reviewers focus on one quality but never on practical use over a longer period of time.


Currently the Jabra elite 75t is 89,- for black friday. 85t's are 149,- which is an insane price jump, just as the difference between the QCY and the 75t's is insane. And even considering wired options are often great as well and so much cheaper.

I am coming from using Monster Achieve 100, but they got ran over by a car after the case fell out of my pocket.

It would mostly be paired with a phone, sometimes a tablet. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. 

Budget is around $100CAD, but I'm willing to reach $150CAD if the leap is warranted.

I'm looking to keep the Achieve 100's style and fit. That means I don't want the long stem style you see in products like Airpods or Anker Life P2 (I have the P2's and I don't really like them). 

Main thing I listen to are podcasts, but I also listen to music on occasion. Various rock, rap, hip hop, hell I sometimes throw pop in there if I'm feeling it. 

What I am looking for, in order of importance:

Most important would be the shape. I want it similar to the Achieve 100's as in I want the little (fin?) that holds the earbud in place. I don't want to scramble trying to grab a fallen earbud. I MIGHT be able to he swayed towards the shape of say the Soundcore Liberty 2/3 pro or galaxy buds, but I don't how much about their fit.

Just as important, I want to be able to have the option to wear ONE earbud. Specifically the left earbud. This would be in an office environment. I bought the Jabra Elite 75T after a month of research, and it turns out they only support dual earbuds or right only. No option for left. I never knew this could be an issue. I tried to work around that by turning both buds on and leaving the right ear out, but I guess the right bud is programmed to pause audio when taken out. Definitely returning the Jabras.

As a given, of course I want good sound. Doesn't have to be Bose Quietcomfort or Sony WF-1000xm4 quality, just something enjoyable.

Next, I would prefer Active Noise Cancellation or at least superb isolation. I have a roughly 40 minute commute if you combine bus and light rail. Doesn't need to be amazing, but I definitely want to notice the effect and don't want the hissing sound you can sometimes find. 

Features that would be an asset, but aren't a complete deal breaker, are:
Mobile app support (eq, settings, etc)
USB C charging (I don't necessarily need wireless charging)
Some form of water protection (IPX4+)
Pass-through sound. Sorry if I got the term wrong. I'm talking about a mode that allows you to hear your surroundings when necessary.


Call quality would be nice, but if the other features are present, I can live without amazing call quality. All I need is ""acceptable"".

I ve tried to use search but nothing came up.

I'm finally making transition from wired 10bugs garbage to wireless earbuds. But here starts the problem. I was thinking about the airpods but I use android so I can't use half of their features and those boneinduction ones, but I think they are not really what I am looking for, seems like I hear to little of surroundings with these. 

I need earbuds which:

-are a bit smaller than those from Samsung, which are to big for my ears, 

-are comfortable under a hood, 

-have the opposite to notice cancelation. I am riding my bike and would love to still hear my surrounding, even maybe a bit louder than it actually is and I need 

-around 8h playtime a day.

So I've had the kz zsn Pro x for a while now and these are probably the best sounding earphones/headphones I've used. I've really grown to like their voice nad no matter what pair of TWS I pick they don't sound as good to me.

I tried a friends galaxy buds 2 and found them lacking.

What I'm looking for is something that sounds good. Mic quality doesn't matter as much but would be an added bonus (I don't want it to sound too bad   atleast good enough for semi quiete environments)

I've considered the FIIL T1 lite (I don't care much about features like ANC so didn't want to buy the pro) or the kz zsn Bluetooth module (the new one with Bluetooth 5.2 and apex HD support) but I've heard bad things about kz when it comes to Bluetooth like disconnects. So If anyone has this module an input would be appreciated!

My price range is about $50ish but if a TWS is under $100 and worth the price idm getting them.

ANC is important to me, and I'm fairly confident in both of these.  
Sony's likely will have better sound quality, but I know I'll be happy with the Bose too.  
Those are non-issue.


It really comes down to 3 main issues,

1. My ears suck. Most earbuds cause my ears to hurt within minutes. I hate it. However I own a pair of wired Bose earbuds and the Stay Hear Ultra tips are fantastic. I can wear them for hours with absolutely no pain.  
This makes me lean towards Bose. I'm afraid the XM4s will hurt.

2. The QCs have a huge ass case. For the times I'm travelling this isn't an issue, I'll have a bag with me - however if I'm just out walking around I don't bring anything with me and it looks like it wouldn't fit in my pocket comfortably, especially if I have keys/phone/etc in there.  
This makes me lean towards the XM4s.

3. This one is the least important, but still worth mentioning.
The XM4s are $349 CAD and the QCs are only $279.

  
  

Does anyone have similar ear comfort issues and have tried the XM4s?

With some Black Friday deals going, I wanted to invest in wireless earbuds - max $120 (give or take $10).

What they should offer:

* Grip: doing frequent workout. Don't want to readjust them after every minor movement.
* Water/sweat-resistant
* Decent battery time (min. 4h)
* Not too heavy/not too big
* Noice cancellation
* And of course: Good sound quality!

The JBL's have some impressive features: high water resistance, high battery life, good sound quality and a lot of eartips/wings.

The LG's in the other hand: UV for killing bacteria, (for what I have seen and heard) great comfort thanks to the design and medical silicone eartips, the case can be used as an audio/bluetooth transmitter, decent battery life, good enough water resistance and good sound.

The thing is, the JBL one's look the best option for me, but I'm a bit worried about the fit. I don't know if these will stay comfortably and secure in my ear when working or doing nothing, because of the big size and the weight. On the other hand, the LG one's look like a great option too, but I can't judge if I will like the sound and the fit as well.

After some debating with myself and blackfriday coming up I've decided to buy a new pair of earbuds.

I've been eyeing the Sony wf-1000xm4 for a while now for their noise cancelling and form factor, but I'm unsure if they're worth the extra 100€ from the Jabra Elite 85t, a pair I know I'll most likely end up loving anyway due to their form factor and similarities to the 65t.

Does anyone know how much the 100€ price jump would be worth it for the Sony's, or perhaps someone has any other recommendations for me? I use earbuds on a daily basis in both public transport and for usage at home.

I have owned Jaybird X4, Jaybird Tarah Pro and I have tried working out with the Jaybird Vista.  
The Jaybird X4 didn't get a good fit at all in my ears, but When I bought the Tarah Pros I got very happily suprised because they did fit perfectly in my ears. The Jaybird Vista fits okay I guess in my ears. But when I really sweat or run for a long time they get a bit loose which is very annoying.

Now I'am looking for Truly wireless earbuds

Important features:

\-  The most imporant thing is that they fit very well in my ear like the Tarah Pro did  
\- They need to block out much sound so that I don't get annoyed in the gym  
\- The Sound should be pretty good  
\- They need to be able to connect to a training watch like the Garmin 245 Music  
\- They need to have volume controll and skip song  
\- Atleast okay battery life  


Things that don't really matter  


\- I don't mind a big case but a small one would't hurt  
\- They don't need to be good at calls

If I don't find any Truly Wireless Earbuds that fit well, Then I will buy the Tarah Pro again but I really want truly wireless ones :D

I'm currently looking for a pair of earbuds, with a budget of about 100-120 AUD (about 70-85 USD). Here's some detail about what I want and how I'll be using them:

I'm looking for wireless earbuds. True wireless would be ideal but I realise that there isn't much good true wireless stuff in my price range so neckband/semi-wireless is suitable as well. Preferably with a rigid plastic back, in order to protect the wire from rough movement. I'd like a single-charge battery life of at least 6 hours. I will be using them mostly with my phone and laptop. I don't want full isolation, but some would be good as I'll be using these everywhere, from home to the gym to my commute. I'd like a balanced sound, though clear bass is fairly important to me. In terms of music tastes, I mostly listen to rock, metal, contemporary classical and ambient music. I am located in Australia.

My neighbors are having constructions which has been affecting my working environment at home. I'm still okay with the noise, since I got help with my current earbuds (Sony WI-C300 &amp; JBL Endurance Run). Unfortunately, they don't bode well for online meetings as the construction noises would disrupt my call input. Although I can hear the other meeting attendees well, they might not or ended up just hearing the construction noises.

Thus, may I ask for recommendation on a pair of earbuds (&lt; US$200) which could help with reducing background noises in the mic? It'll be great if it has a noise cancelling feature too.

I am currently trying out both the Jabra Elite 85T and Anker Liberty Pro 3's but so far neither are meeting my needs as much as the Galaxy Buds Pro did.

For reference my hearing is subpar so audio quality is less important as fit, good ANC, good transparency mode, and a good mic for call. Multipoint is also important as I am constantly going back and forth between my Samsung phone and tablet.  Wireless charging is ideal but if I had to give it up to get everything else I could live without it.

Based on those requirements I slightly prefer the 85t's as at least for my ears the fit is more secure and transparency mode is better (although still not as good as the Galaxy Buds). ANC seems about the same no both but the mic is much better on the Liberty's plus it handles wind noise much better than the 85t's (although again not as well as the Galaxy Buds)

I also feel like the Liberty's are a bit unpolished with the current firmware. I have lots of issues where I will take them out of the case, put them in my ears and only one bud will work which requires me to fiddle with it to get it to activate. I also hate the amount of gymnastics it takes to get them in and out of the case correctly.

Are there any other buds based on what I am looking for that I should consider?  I have heard the newer Jabra Elite 7 Pro's have a better mic than the 85t's but I am also hearing the current firmware is buggy with poor ANC and no Multipoint yet.

Im a musician singing in a medium loud two piece band (guitar and drums). My hearing has been damaged over the years playing full time in more than medium loud bands and as a result im desperately trying to cling on to what hearing i have left. 

Ive used all sorts of ear plugs over the years including custom molds, and ofc they all suffer the problem of giving you the boomy headvoice that ruins your experience as a vocalist. 

Finally i started using Bose QC 25s to jam and wow they are perfect. The eq profile they attenuate removes all the low mid mud and leaves softened but clear mids and highs, without any headvoice, so i can monitor my mic control and hear the room as if i werent wearing hearing protection. They occasionally clip but not enough to be a big deal. Im hoping 7 or so years of ANC tech has made things better in this regard. 

So unfortunately although they are perfect in the auditory sense, the look of wearing headphones on stage is a deal breaker. Im hoping that there are some earbuds (preferably cheap) that have exceptionally strong ANC and that are ported like the airpod pros to eliminate the headvoice. Sound quality literally doesnt matter, i will only be using them as battery powered earplugs. Bonus points if theyre wired, as i could then use them as IEMs. I hate the foam tips on my IEMs and cant ever get them into my ear canals, i need a small silicon tip which defeats the purpose unfortunately.

* Sounds is good, great clarity and bass, bit piercing high end
* Good ANC
* Firmware updates shows improvement commitment 
* Good mic

Cons 

* ANC feels dirty in loud environment
* Puttings buds back in case is difficult 

Soundcore liberty 3 pro (Firmware 4.58, L3P) is a great earbud but comes with some serious downfalls for me. The earbuds have a sleek case that is pocketable, good for carrying around. However to wear the buds, you need to rotate the buds 180\* degree before putting into your ear, this is still ok as you can get the hang of it. Putting back the earbuds is a different story, its feel really unintuitive to take your earbuds out, rotate it 180\* then put it back. Not really suitable for storing earbuds on the go and storing these becomes a really deliberate action. 

The sound quality is pretty good with the earbuds. I have a bad ear for identity sound quality and will try my best here. Vocal and bass is good, bass is really heavy and clear, vocal clarity is clear for wireless earbuds. However, high ends sometimes feel sharp and piercing, which could be fixed with custom EQ. 

HearID ANC works in L3P. Using Android’s soundcore app for HearID, it requires the mic access only when HearID is running. I think that it's using the phone app alongside the earbuds to do some tuning for the ANC. The ANC works well in a normal environment, better than AirPods Pro in some situations. In a loud environment the ANC is able to tune down the noise, but at the same time it feels like it's casting a layer of thin white noise for the ANC to work. This approach just makes the ANC feel dirty when it's used in a loud environment like during my bus commute. 

Earbuds have been used for 3 days and already received 2 updates, one out of box, and a recent one that fixed the previously lousy mic. Regardless, I will put this for sale, it's a great buds but the difficult storing and the dirty ANC make it not suitable for my commute purpose.

I am wondering which Wireless In Ear Headset could be a better option for me, i already have a HyperX Cloud Alpha S for Bass Sound and Console Gaming but i want a wireless headset that sound great for listen music (I listen a great variety of music), watch netflix and phone talks

By one side, i like the Sony WF-XB700, it has physical buttons, apparently it's sound nice, a nice charger and it has a price of 60-70$, good

But in the other side, the Samsung has it own app, it's not all focused in bass sound, it's own updates and with a Samsung Galaxy (i have it) it's has his own animations, etc, and it's at 80$ more or less

My main concern is which one is the more confortable in long sessions, which one sound better and which one is more specified when interacting with them, especially by the tactil pads, and idk if with time when i clean it, could damage it and not work, but the Sony idk if the lack of updates could be a problem in the future

Ok so I bought new earbuds since the soundcore liberty air 2 pros I bought the last time hurt my ears and didn't wanna fit well, tested these edifiers for half an hour and couldn't tell if they're better, they seemed more comfortable, and they prolly are, but wearing them half an hour already brings my ears fatigue 🥲🥲 idk I guess it's the airpods form that I don't like (with this stem), before that I only had round earbuds like Xiaomi airdots and they were pretty comfortable for my ears but well.. 

-- SOUND 
so when I tried these earbuds the first thing I noticed right away was that the sound quality was not that much different than the soundcores, dynamic mode was on by default but to me it sounded kinda artificial so I put them on classic mode and now they sound almost exactly like liberty air 2 pro (to my ears). And this is good sound quality, everything is balanced I literally get goose bumps, even bass is fine (although I don't really like too much bass, so the songs I listen to are usually acoustic) they do mix stuff when there's too much going on in the song but I guess that's ok

-- APP
But what makes them different from the soundcore earbuds is this absurdly stupid app. First of all it keeps asking for the permission to work on top of apps - I have no idea why. Secondly it has this stupid panel in the notifications panel (I personally hate to have anything permanent in my notifications panel) and they don't provide any setting to turn it off🥲 so I had to disable it via android os tools. The app itself looks like they made it yesterday in a hurry🥲 u can see I'm not lying if you check its rating on Google play store 😅 it's really such a contrast when u first get the earbuds and their packaging is pretty good, they even include a bag for the case, but then u download the app and now u look like u just bought a pair of 3$ earbuds but paid 100+$ for them ahah 

-- ANC
honestly anc on these earbuds seems a bit stronger than on the soundcores, the soundcores they kinda have this hiss and u wonder what's the point of replacing the ambient noise with this hiss the earbuds themselves produce))) with these there's also a bit of noise present but they're still a bit better I think.

So in the end I wasn't really impressed by these earbuds and I'm not even an audiophile who's pampered by awesome expensive earbuds, these are only second earbuds that I'm buying within the same budget.. what turned me off was the app firstly, secondly I expected a lot better quality than from the soundcore liberty air 2 pros but nope, also these stupid voice lines every time you change a mode are so annoying, and there's no way to turn them off 😅 
Would I personally recommend them to anyone? No way. Their sound quality is ok but the user interface is laughable, they act like cheap earbuds from Ali, like those counterfeit earpods you can buy lol but that's only my take on it, someone more experienced like El Jefe would prolly have a more educated opinion on this 😌",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,6862,public,self,"Edifier neobuds pro - good sound quality, laughably bad app",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/qv2lxl/edifier_neobuds_pro_good_sound_quality_laughably/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to buy the Libratone Track Air+.
I really like their design, I want noise cancelling, they get good reviews... I want them and not other earbuds.
Since the 2nd generation of them is out, I'm waiting for a sale on them, maybe black friday.
The thing is that the 1st gen Air+ are on sale right now for 120€ (Amazon) while the 2nd Gen's are still at 200€.
Should I wait for the 2nd Gen's to hopefully go on sale on black friday or should I get the 1st Gen now?
Reviews say that the 2nd Gen isn't that better, but a little better in about every aspect (sound, noise cancelling etc.).
I'd want the Gen 2's more but 80€ are 80€...

The next thing is that they really hurt my ears, I know comfort is really subjective, but to me their design is so naively stupid, it's hard to imagine anyone could find them comfortable. Other than that they're pretty lit. The battery life is solid, they charge pretty fast, the battery indicators in the case are pretty good, the case itself is pretty easy to use and it looks awesome. My overall impression is that they're so good, I wish they didn't hurt my ears like that 🥲 but I'm thinking of taking them back and exchanging for 1more comfobuds pro, which were actually pretty comfortable in my ears, they felt like they were made for my ears but I bought these soundcore earbuds just cuz I was really impressed by their sound quality..",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,6837,public,self,Soundcore liberty air 2 pro - good sound quality - no comfort,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/qtwavr/soundcore_liberty_air_2_pro_good_sound_quality_no/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,

A few days ago I bought new set of WF XM4 for roughly $179. I had to make a quick thinking because had a limited time to make a decision.

Now I have been reading posts and comments about XM4. I couldn't find many positive reviews, most of them are mixed reviews.

I have Bose QC35 ii and a WF-1000XM3. Had Bose since early of this year and XM3 for 2 months. I wear my Bose a lot more because it is much comfortable and super long battery life. My XM3 feels like want to fall out from my ear and the battery is too short. I used XM3 less than 10 times and gonna sell it to my friend soon.

I need some thoughts to help me making another decision. To receive or to cancel the XM4. To be honest, I never owned a earphones/headphones that costs more than  $10 for the past years. I couldn't really tell the differences between sound quality of my Bose and XM3 other than XM3 being a bit more rich in sound.

Hoping to see some nice comments here.

Having surfed the internet for quite some days now made me even more confused.
Personally I'm biased towards stem styled tws in that they look like you mean business and could work even in formal settings unlike the bud styled ones which are rather sporty.

I have my eyes on a number of tws in each price bracket but haven't been able to commit to one. Initially it was about just having a pair in 30ish dollar but delving into the market and the variety of products made me push my budget and search for the best bang for the buck . 
Here is my carefully crafted tentative list in each price category :

30$ ish : FIL t lite , edifier tws 1 pro ,

40$ ish : sound peats te3 se, sound peats sonic 

50-60$ ish : ear fun free pro, FIL t1 pro , sound peats h1, flybuds c1, sound core life p3

Even willing to explore the 70$ ish bracket if it offers a more comprehensive product.

My major dilemma with this is that I I want everything in the product that I lay my hands on to. Comfortable and secure fit(not too bulky), good battery life, low latency, pocketable case, preferably an app support,clear mics and a balanced sound signature with emphasis on mids and vocals and a bass that hits deep with a thump and rumble but at no point becomes too bassy or muddy or too piercing and has enough air to it and proper instrument separation.

I wasn´t using my soundpeats Sonic earbuds for around two months. Now it seems that the charging case does not do anything. No LED light, no reaction to USB connection or bud insertion.

I always manually switch off the earbuds so the buds itself are working fine and are fully loaded, but it seems the charging case discharged itself during this time completely to a point where the internal li-io battery is just dead ( I know that if the voltage of those batteries falls below a certain point they are dead and cannot be recharged...). 

So what now? Is this a warranty issue or ""my own fault""? In my opinion the charging case should have a saftey function to internally switch off if the voltage falls below a certain point (like, for example, most LED flashlights have...).",True,False,False,Earbuds,t5_2seth,6803,public,self,SoundPeats Sonic charging case is dead,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/qs800p/soundpeats_sonic_charging_case_is_dead/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They serve me fine, but I’ve been trying to make a switch to truly wireless headphones for a while. For a variety of reasons, but not having my headphones tangle up with my mask when I want to take one or the other off would free me of most burdens in life. 

The problem is, and this is driving me crazy, every pair I’ve tried just sounds terrible in my ears. The sound comes through muffled, it’s clearly harder to distinguish different instruments in music, and the volume never seems to get nearly as loud as my “wireless but with a wire” earbuds.

For context I’ve most recently tried the Earfun Free 2 and Jabra Elite 75t, as well as 1-2 a while ago that I can’t remember. Now based on the reviews for these pairs and everyone else’s experience, it’s obvious my $20 earbuds don’t just magically deliver better sound quality, but something must be going on because the difference is quite stark to me (and not in a positive way).

My main suspicion is that my ear geometry is just not compatible with these earbuds for some reason. The truly wireless earbuds I’ve tried all sit in my ear in a specific way that other earbuds don’t. They feel like they’re lodged in place and sitting deeper in my ear.

Been using the Panasonic RZ-S500W earbuds for a while, but recently the sound is super deep when the ANC or ambient sound mode is on, but when those are off the sound is (ironically) super flat. The buds and the mesh are clean. Even if Panasonic doesn't recommend it, I tried cleaning them with rubbing alcohol when they got too dirty as their cleaning guide didn't really help.

This was my first time returning/warrantying anything, and it was a horrible experience.

TLDR: Order earbuds on August 27, 2021 with express 2-day shipping for an extra $23.50, received broken earbuds 6 days later. Dealt with horrible, insulting, and  slow customer service that finally accepted my warranty on September 20th that I had to pay an extra $20 to ship back. Finally received my ear buds 74 days after purchase on November 9th.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to buy a pair of Mifo O5 plus from [mifoaudio.ca](https://mifoaudio.ca), after doing research on several pairs. My decision was made due to their high battery life in the case, as well as good customer service reviews. 

My order was placed on August 27th, and I paid an extra $23.50 for express 2-day shipping since I was heading on a back country hike on September 1st, and bought these for that specific hike. It arrived on September 3rd, 6 days after the purchase date. I wasn't too upset at this as I requested a refund on the express shipping which was finally approved after several frustrating emails back and forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this was the end of it, I would still have left a 4/5 star review. However, the left earbud never even turned on. The instant I took it out of the box, the left earbud never had any power, never played a single second of music, and never charged. Of course, I charged the earbud case, I ensured the earbud was in contact with the charging lead, and nothing happened after a couple hours of charging.  

I instantly sent Mifo an email about this, which I was sent a response with steps on ensuring the earbud is properly charging, to clean the contact leads, to reset the earbud, to ensure Bluetooth connection, etc. I followed all the steps, and ensured the customer service agent it was an issue with the earbud never even turning on, but it seemed like the agent never even read my response, and listed a second list of actions I could take to reset the earbud. It was almost a direct copy of the first instructions, just more in depth, assuming I didn't understand the first email. I sent back a VIDEO, of me conducting those exact steps to reset, or charge the earbuds, proving that the earbud will not charge. 

For a 3rd time, they responded with a final list of instructions, again repeating the exact steps I have just performed on video. Clearly they did not read my last email, and even actually wrote the instructions in more depth as if I do not understand how to use electronics or read instructions. Also, these instructions were all on how to reset or properly charge the earbud, which I have no said over 3 times that it was not the issue. It also took multiple days for some responses and this part of my warranty was dragged on for over a week just to be exactly where I started. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, over 10 emails back and forth, they ""approved"" my warranty, and all I had to do was pay for tracked shipping and return it back to their warehouse. I asked if I could be reimbursed for this shipping, and was sent a snarky return stating how because they would be paying for the default shipping of the new pair back to me (default shipping is free for the customer on any earbud purchase keep in mind), and that they were doing me a favour by warrantying the earbuds FOR ME? I never broke the earbuds, I never used them, and they made it seem like a huge favour that they would be replacing them for me.  To avoid taking a &gt;$100 dollar loss now, I paid $20 for shipping and returned the pair back to them on September 20th. 

Now, the biggest insult out of this exchange, I only just finally received the earbuds today on November 9th.... over a month after shipping my pair back. I inquired about the process on my warranty on October 15th, and was sent a response that they have processed the warranty and they are just waiting on a tracking number from their dispatch team. I received my tracking information  over 2 weeks later on November 3rd. Not only did I pay $20 extra, than any other Mifo 05 plus customer, I received them 74 days after the date of purchase. I have not done any testing on if this earbud was worth the money, but nothing will be worth that 74 day wait, with the additional insult from the customer service experience. 

Throughout my conversation with them, I stated multiple times how displeased I was, even apologizing when I got frustrated with their copy and paste responses, and got nothing but scripted responses and no reimbursement besides the express shipping costs.

Since I moved from the countryside to a big city I've had trouble getting quality sleep.

I think that has to do with traffic and overall noise of people in bars and in the streets since my appartment is up a narrow street and noice reverbates.

Earplugs are hit or miss, most of the time they just fall or don't fit properly. And having to change them regularly is a pain.

I have cheap earbuds already, Xiaomi's AirDots I bought for 15€ a little over a year ago and I'm very pleased with them. Surprisingly okay for the price.

But I think I want to upgrade to something better, and also to something that can help me sleep better if it exists.

What are your recommendations for this kind of use ?

I don't think I can go over 150€, but depending on the product I might go over.

Keep in mind, though, this is based on my opinion and hers alone, and the website used for the audio was [rtings.com](https://rtings.com). Only no disturbance sounds tests were used as that was her use case. 

**Cost-effective - Tozo T6:** anything cheaper than this was just too poor to consider. These sounded audibly worse than the best below, but were also much better than a lot of more expensive buds.

**Flat out Best - Galaxy Buds 2:** of the about 50 to 75 earbuds we went through, the buds 2 were the fullest sounding, best overall call quality earbuds in a quiet environment.

General brand trends noticed: Apple and Bose didn't stand a chance. Both were substantially worse than the buds 2. Sony and JBL sounded hollow and were worse than the buds 2, but still better than the previous 2 brands.
